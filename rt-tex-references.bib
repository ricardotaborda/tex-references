  Abstract                 = {We estimate the ground motions produced by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake making use of the recently developed Song et al. (2008) source model that combines the available geodetic and seismic observations and recently constructed 3D geologic and seismic velocity models. Our estimates of the ground motions for the 1906 earthquake are consistent across five ground-motion modeling groups employing different wave propagation codes and simulation domains. The simulations successfully reproduce the main features of the Boatwright and Bundock (2005) ShakeMap, but tend to over predict the intensity of shaking by 0.1-0.5 modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) units. Velocity waveforms at sites throughout the San Francisco Bay Area exhibit characteristics consistent with rupture directivity, local geologic conditions (e.g., sedimentary basins), and the large size of the event (e.g., durations of strong shaking lasting tens of seconds). We also compute ground motions for seven hypothetical scenarios rupturing the same extent of the northern San Andreas fault, considering three additional hypocenters and an additional, random distribution of slip. Rupture directivity exerts the strongest influence on the variations in shaking, although sedimentary basins do consistently contribute to the response in some locations, such as Santa Rosa, Livermore, and San Jose. These scenarios suggest that future large earthquakes on the northern San Andreas fault may subject the current San Francisco Bay urban area to stronger shaking than a repeat of the 1906 earthquake. Ruptures propagating southward towards San Francisco appear to expose more of the urban area to a given intensity level than do ruptures propagating northward.},

  Abstract                 = {We simulate long-period ($T>1.0$--2.0 s) and broadband ($T>0.1$ s) ground motions for 39 scenario earthquakes (Mw 6.7-7.2) involving the Hayward, Calaveras, and Rodgers Creek faults. For rupture on the Hayward fault, we consider the effects of creep on coseismic slip using two different approaches, both of which reduce the ground motions, compared with neglecting the influence of creep. Nevertheless, the scenario earthquakes generate strong shaking throughout the San Francisco Bay area, with about 50 percent of the urban area experiencing modified Mercalli intensity VII or greater for the magnitude 7.0 scenario events. Long-period simulations of the 2007 Mw 4.18 Oakland earthquake and the 2007 Mw 5.45 Alum Rock earthquake show that the U.S. Geological Survey's Bay Area Velocity Model version 08.3.0 permits simulation of the amplitude and duration of shaking throughout the San Francisco Bay area for Hayward fault earthquakes, with the greatest accuracy in the Santa Clara Valley (San Jose area). The ground motions for the suite of scenarios exhibit a strong sensitivity to the rupture length (or magnitude), hypocenter (or rupture directivity), and slip distribution. The ground motions display a much weaker sensitivity to the rise time and rupture speed. Peak velocities, peak accelerations, and spectral accelerations from the synthetic broadband ground motions are, on average, slightly higher than the Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) ground-motion prediction equations. We attribute much of this difference to the seismic velocity structure in the San Francisco Bay area and how the NGA models account for basin amplification; the NGA relations may underpredict amplification in shallow sedimentary basins. The simulations also suggest that the Spudich and Chiou (2008) directivity corrections to the NGA relations could be improved by increasing the areal extent of rupture directivity with period.},

  Abstract                 = {We construct kinematic earthquake rupture models for a suite of 39 Mw 6.6--7.2 scenario earthquakes involving the Hayward, Calaveras, and Rodgers Creek faults. We use these rupture models in 3D ground-motion simulations as discussed in Part II (Aagaard et al., 2010) to provide detailed estimates of the shaking for each scenario. We employ both geophysical constraints and empirical relations to provide realistic variation in the rupture dimensions, slip heterogeneity, hypocenters, rupture speeds, and rise times. The five rupture lengths include portions of the Hayward fault as well as combined rupture of the Hayward and Rodgers Creek faults and the Hayward and Calaveras faults. We vary rupture directivity using multiple hypocenters, typically three per rupture length, yielding north-to-south rupture, bilateral rupture, and south-to-north rupture. For each rupture length and hypocenter, we consider multiple random distributions of slip. We use two approaches to account for how aseismic creep might reduce coseismic slip. For one subset of scenarios, we follow the slip-predictable approach and reduce the nominal slip in creeping regions according to the creep rate and time since the most recent earthquake, whereas for another subset of scenarios we apply a vertical gradient to the nominal slip in creeping regions. The rupture models include local variations in rupture speed and use a ray-tracing algorithm to propagate the rupture front. Although we are not attempting to simulate the 1868 Hayward fault earthquake in detail, a few of the scenarios are designed to have source parameters that might be similar to this historical event.},

  Abstract                 = {SMART 1 is the first large digital array of strong-motion seismographs specially designed for engineering and seismological studies of the generation and near-field properties of earthquakes. Since the array began operation in September 1980, it has recorded over 3000 accelerogram traces from 48 earthquakes ranging in local magnitude (ML) from 3.6 to 7.0. Peak ground accelerations have been recorded up to 0.33g and 0.34g on the horizontal and vertical components, respectively. Epicentral distances have ranged from 3 km 200 km from the array center, and focal depths have ranged from shallow to 100 km. The recorded earthquakes had both reverse and strike-slip focal mechanisms associated with the subduction zone and transform faults. These high quality, digital, ground motions provide a varied resource for earthquake engineering research. Earthquake engineering studies of the SMART 1 ground motion data have led to advances in knowledge in several cases: for example, on frequency-dependent incoherency of free-surface ground motions over short distances, on response of linear systems to multiple support excitations, on attenuation of peak ground-motion parameters and response spectra, on site torsion and phasing effects, and on the identification of wave types. Accelerograms from individual strong-motion seismographs do not, in general, provide such information. This review describes the SMART 1 array and the recorded earthquakes with special engineering applications. Also, it tabulates the unfiltered peak array accelerations, displays some of the recorded ground motion time histories, and summarizes the main engineering research that has made use of SMART 1 data.},

  Abstract                 = {Clear nonlinear behavior is analyzed from the acceleration records of the 1995 Hyogo-ken Nanbu earthquake at Port Island, Kobe. From four triaxial instruments placed at four different depths, the surficial effects during strong ground motions were compared with those during weak motions before and after the mainshock. We used a spectral ratio technique and a nonlinear inversion for velocity structure to analyze the data. From the spectral analysis, we observed a large variation of the spectral ratios between the surface and different depths during the strong ground motions and during the liquefied state. The spectral ratios after the mainshock (i.e., after the liquefied state) are different from those before the mainshock. The peak frequencies in the spectral ratios after the mainshock are shifted to lower frequencies with respect to those in the spectral ratios before the mainshock. We inverted the S-wave velocities using a genetic algorithm technique to determine the velocity structure before, during, and after the mainshock. The $S$-wave velocity structure before and after the mainshock was found to be different. Specifically, the $S$-wave velocity of the second layer (5 m to 16 m depth) after the mainshock was 20 percent lower than before. Our analysis shows that the liquefied state remains at least 3 hr after the mainshock but no more than 24 hr. The rigidity of the soil decreased close to zero when liquefaction happened and later increases gradually following a trend that resembles a consolidation curve. The strong influence of nonlinearity during the mainshock yielded a big reduction of the horizontal surface ground motions, so that the observed horizontal peak acceleration was only about 25 percent of the peak acceleration expected from the linear theory. However, the nonlinear effects in the vertical peak acceleration were not significant.},

Our wave propagation solver sustains 1.21 teraflop/s for 4 hours on 3000 AlphaServer processors at 80 percent parallel efficiency. Because of uncertainties in characterizing earthquake source and basin material properties, a critical remaining challenge is to invert for source and material parameter fields for complex 3D basins from records of past earthquakes. Towards this end, we present results for material and source inversion of high-resolution models of basins undergoing antiplane motion using parallel scalable inversion algorithms that overcome many of the difficulties particular to inverse heterogeneous wave propagation problems.},

This paper describes how this development of Strong Motion Seismology occurred in a relatively short time span of around three decades. We also discuss the emergence of the concept of the master model for a broader integration of earthquake information, of which Strong Motion Seismology is a key part, promoted at the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) in the past decade. We shall conclude the paper with a future perspective for Strong Motion Seismology.},

  Abstract                 = {The Parkfield, California, earthquake of 1966 produced the first recording of ground motion in the immediate vicinity of an earthquake fault. The simplicity of displacement pulse observed at station 2 aroused great interest among seismologists working in the area of earthquake source mechanism. Since then, numerous theoretical works on simulating strong motion have been carried out, starting with the use of a simple kinematic model assuming a uniform slip over a fault plane. The assumption of uniform slip had to be modified to explain the strong motion observed during the Parkfield earthquake of 1966, the Borrego Mountain earthquake of 1968, the San Fernando earthquake of 1971, the Imperial Valley earthquake of 1979, the El Asnam earthquake of 1980, and others. Through these studies, the simulation technique has been advanced to include a more realistic medium. In the beginning, most methods used Green's function for an unbounded homogeneous medium. Then, the free surface effect, the effect of a sedimentary layer as well as laterally heterogeneous basin structure have been included in the simulation. The above simulation studies were, however, restricted to relatively low-frequency waves represented in a displacement or velocity seismogram. In order to predict an acceleration seismogram dominated by high-frequency waves, hybrid models have been proposed in which gross features of rupture propagation are specified deterministically, but the details of the process are described by a stochastic model specified by a small number of parameters. The application of these models to several California earthquakes revealed encouraging results that some of the key parameters of the model are stable among earthquakes. Mathematical modeling techniques will play an important role in the prediction of strong motion for a great earthquake in California as well as for major earthquakes outside California, based on the records of moderate earthquakes already acquired in California.},

  Abstract                 = {The dependence of the amplitude spectrum of seismic waves on source size is investigated on the basis of two dislocation models of an earthquake source. One of the models (by N. Haskell) is called the omega^3 model, and the other, called the omega^2 model, is constructed by fitting an exponentially decaying function to the autocorrelation function of the dislocation velocity. The number of source parameters is reduced to one by the assumption of similarity. We found that the most convenient parameter for our purpose is the magnitude M s, defined for surface waves with period of 20 sec. Spectral density curves are determined for given M s. Comparison of the theoretical curves with observations is made in two different ways. The observed ratios of the spectra of seismic waves with the same propagation path but from earthquakes of different sizes are compared with the corresponding theoretical ratios, thereby eliminating the effect of propagation on the spectrum. The other method is to check the theory with the empirical relation between different magnitude scales defined for different waves at different periods. The omega^2 model gives a satisfactory agreement with such observations on the assumption of similarity, but the omega^3 model does not. We find, however, some indications of departure from similarity. The efficiency of seismic radiation seems to increase with decreasing magnitude if the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-energy relation is valid. The assumption of similarity implies a constant stress drop independent of source size. A preliminary study of Love waves from the Parkfield earthquake of June 28, 1966, shows that the stress drop at the source of this earthquake is lower than the normal value (around 100 bars) by about 2 orders of magnitude.},

A simulation of the shaking table test is performed by applying the proposed constitutive model.

The effect of different mesh sizes on the theoretical seismograms is studied next and a suitable grid system selected for the applications that follow. The development of Rayleigh waves on the surface of a half-space and the change of the Rayleigh wave with depth and pulse width are examined. The problem of a layered half-space with a high velocity bottom is considered and the refraction arrivals on the surface and on the interface are studied. The problem of interface waves on the surface separating two semiinfinite media is also examined. Interface waves are found when the physical parameters lie both inside and outside the region determined by the Stoneley equation. Finally, a series of theoretical seismograms for a layered half-space showing the variation of the surface waves as a function of depth and of the density in the lower medium is presented.},

To check our numerical procedure we compare our results for a circular fault in a full space with Kostrov's (1964) analytic solution for a self-similar propagating stress relaxation. We have simulated two bilateral strike-slip earthquakes differing only in hypocentral location and examined the particle motion on the traction-free surface and on the rupture surface. Focusing of energy is evident in both ruptures. The static displacement on the rupture surface overshoots the theoretical static value by approximately 25 per cent. For the rupture that nucleated at depth the free surface almost doubled the particle velocities along the fault trace as compared with the rupture that nucleated at the free surface. Our numerical results indicate that for an earthquake occurring on a semi-circular fault with radius of 10 km, an effective stress of 100 bars and a rupture velocity of 0.9{beta} in a medium characterized by beta = 3 km/sec, alpha = ? and a density of 2.7 gm/cm3 particle velocities can reach 400 cm/sec and displacements 250 cm. We also compare our numerical results with the observations made by Archuleta and Brune (1975) for a spontaneous stress relaxation on a semi-circular crack in a prestressed foam rubber block.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a least-squares optimization method for solving the nonlinear full waveform inverse problem of determining the crustal velocity and intrinsic attenuation properties of sedimentary valleys in earthquake-prone regions. Given a known earthquake source and a set of seismograms generated by the source, the inverse problem is to reconstruct the anelastic properties of a heterogeneous medium with possibly discontinuous wave velocities. The inverse problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, where the constraints are the partial and ordinary differential equations governing the anelastic wave propagation from the source to the receivers in the time domain. This leads to a variational formulation in terms of the material model plus the state variables and their adjoints. We employ a wave propagation model in which the intrinsic energy-dissipating nature of the soil medium is modeled by a set of standard linear solids. The least-squares optimization approach to inverse wave propagation presents the well-known difficulties of ill posedness and multiple minima. To overcome ill posedness, we include a total variation regularization functional in the objective function, which annihilates highly oscillatory material property components while preserving discontinuities in the medium. To treat multiple minima, we use a multilevel algorithm that solves a sequence of subproblems on increasingly finer grids with increasingly higher frequency source components to remain within the basin of attraction of the global minimum. We illustrate the methodology with high-resolution inversions for two-dimensional sedimentary models of the San Fernando Valley, under SH-wave excitation. We perform inversions for both the seismic velocity and the intrinsic attenuation using synthetic waveforms at the observer locations as pseudoobserved data.},

  Abstract                 = {This article is concerned with the problem of seismic inversion in the presence of model uncertainty. In a recent article (Askan et al., 2007), we described an inverse adjoint anelastic wave propagation algorithm for determining the crustal velocity and attenuation properties of basins in earthquake-prone regions. We formulated the tomography problem as a constrained optimization problem where the constraints are the partial and the ordinary differential equations that govern the anelastic wave propagation from the source to the receivers. We employed a wave propagation model in which the intrinsic energy-dissipating nature of the soil medium was modeled by a set of standard linear solids. Assuming no information was initially available on the target shear-wave velocity distribution, we employed a homogeneous shear-wave velocity profile as the initial guess. In practice, some information is usually available. The purpose of the present article is to modify our nonlinear inversion method to start from an initial velocity model, and include a priori information regarding the initial model parameters in the misfit (objective) function. To represent model uncertainties, given an initial velocity model, in addition to the data misfit term in our objective function, we include an L2-normed weighting term, which quantifies the model estimation errors, independently of the measured data. We use total variation (TV) regularization to overcome ill posedness. We illustrate the methodology with pseudo-observed data from two-dimensional sedimentary models of the San Fernando Valley, using a source model with an antiplane slip function.},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of near-surface soil stratigraphy on the amplitude and frequency content of ground motion are accounted for in most modern U.S. seismic design codes for building structures as a function of the soil conditions prevailing in the area of interest. Nonetheless, currently employed site-classification criteria do not adequately describe the nonlinearity susceptibility of soil formations, which prohibits the development of standardized procedures for the computationally efficient integration of nonlinear ground response analyses in broadband ground-motion simulations. In turn, the lack of a unified methodology for nonlinear site-response analyses affects both the prediction accuracy of site-specific ground-motion intensity measures and the evaluation of site-amplification factors when broadband simulations are used for the development of hybrid attenuation relations. In this article, we introduce a set of criteria for quantification of the nonlinearity susceptibility of soil profiles based on the site conditions and incident ground-motion characteristics, and we implement them to identify the least complex ground response prediction methodology required for the simulation of nonlinear site effects at three sites in the Los Angeles basin. The criteria are developed on the basis of a comprehensive nonlinear site-response modeling uncertainty analysis, which includes both detailed soil profile descriptions and statistical adequacy of ground-motion time histories. Approximate and incremental nonlinear models are implemented, and the limited site-response observations are initially compared to the ensemble site-response estimates. A suite of synthetic ground motions for rupture scenarios of weak, medium, and large magnitude events (M 3.5--7.5) is next generated, parametric studies are conducted for each fixed magnitude scenario by varying the source-to-site distance, and the variability introduced in ground-motion predictions is quantified for each nonlinear site-response methodology. A frequency index is developed to describe the frequency content of incident ground motion relative to the resonant frequencies of the soil profile, and this index is used in conjunction with the rock-outcrop acceleration peak amplitude (PGA_RO) to identify the site conditions and ground-motion characteristics where incremental nonlinear analyses should be employed in lieu of approximate methodologies. We show that the proposed intensity-frequency representation of ground motion may be implemented to describe the nonlinearity susceptibility of soil formations in broadband simulations by accounting both for the magnitude-distance-orientation characteristics of seismic motion and the profile stiffness characteristics. The synthetic ground-motion predictions are next used for the development of site-amplification factors for the alternative site-response methodologies, and the results are compared to published site factors of attenuation relations. For the site conditions investigated, currently established amplification factors compare well with synthetic simulations for class C and D site conditions, while long-period amplification factors are overestimated by a factor of 1.5 at the class E site, where site-specific nonlinear analyses should be employed for levels of PGA_RO greater than 0.2g.},

  Abstract                 = {The New Madrid seismic zone is the most important regional seismic hazard in middle America, having produced several very large earthquakes in historic and geologic time. In this study we simulate time histories in Memphis, Tennessee, and St. Louis, Missouri, for M 7.5 and M 8.0 earthquakes along two faults in the New Madrid seismic zone. Simulations are based on a well-established and calibrated finite-fault simulation program (FINSIM), which has been shown to reproduce ground motions for earthquakes of M 4-8 in eastern and western North America (Beresnev and Atkinson, 2001a). Simulations are made for representative soil profiles for each city, as well as for reference bedrock conditions (at the base of the soil profile); the effect of nonlinearity on soil amplification is considered for the soil sites. Uncertainty in the results is considered by modeling a wide range of alternative scenarios, representing the major uncertainties in input parameters. The total uncertainty in ground motions (response spectra) is about a factor of 2. Results are most sensitive to magnitude, hypocenter location (directivity effects), and maximum slip velocity. The resulting time histories and spectra for all modeled scenarios are available as an electronic supplement to this article. 
Results are validated to the extent possible using the modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) observations from the 1811-1812 earthquakes. The simulated motions are consistent with MMI observations at St. Louis and Memphis. It is not possible to distinguish, based on the MMI observations, which of the M 7.5 or M 8.0 scenarios are most likely. However, we conclude that the most extreme scenarios, such as M 8.0 with high slip velocity or large directivity effects, are not likely because they would produce higher MMI values than those that were observed.},

We target large sedimentary basins with contrasts in wavelengths of over an order of magnitude. Regular grid methods prove intractable for such problems. We overcome the problem of multiple physical scales by using unstructured finite elements on locally-resolved Delaunay triangulations derived from octree-based grids. The extremely large mesh sizes require special mesh generation techniques. Despite the method's multiresolution capability, large problem sizes necessitate the use of distributed memory parallel supercomputers to solve the elastic wave propagation problem. We have developed a system that helps automate the task of writing efficient portable unstructured mesh solvers for distributed memory parallel supercomputers. The numerical methodology and software system have been used to simulate the seismic response of the San Fernando Valley in Southern California to an aftershock of the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. We report on parallel performance on the Cray T3D for several models of the basin ranging in size from 35 000 to 77 million tetrahedra.

  Abstract                 = {The effects of soil-structure interaction on ground motion are investigated through simple though realistic numerical simulations. The model consist of a single SDOF building resting at the surface of a horizontally stratified half-space. Building motion, base forces and moments are estimated through foundation impedance functions, and the 3D wavefield radiated back into the stratified half-space is computed with discrete wavenumber technique. Results obtained for simple configurations do confirm the possibility of significant modifications of the ``free-field'' motion up to distance of a few hundred meters from large size buildings resting on very soft soils; the origin of these modifications is shown to be principally the SSI induced rocking motion of buildings, which is larger for embedded foundations (deep pile foundations we not considered).},

These strong-motion recordings exhibited the pulses of the main event. One station recorded the largest velocity ever instrumentally recorded (177 cm/sec), resulting from a 0.86 g peak acceleration with a low frequency. Throughout the complex, the horizontal accelerations reached peak values ranging from 0.56 to 1.0 g, except for the complex center, where the peak acceleration did not exceed 0.43 g. The vertical acceleration reached maximum peak values comparable with those of the horizontal acceleration. The acceleration response spectra in the longitudinal and transverse directions were significantly different. Such a difference, which is not yet well documented in the field of geotechnical earthquake engineering, indicates that the amplitude and frequency content of the ground motion was directionally dependent in the Van Norman Complex.},

During the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, the soils underlying the Marina District amplified the ground motion as in 1906 and caused the liquefaction of the superficial sandy materials that were used to fill the old lagoon in 1915. Damage in the Marina District was concentrated along the edges of the old lagoon. The sand boils left behind by liquefaction were useful to delineate the liquefied area and to understand the ground displacement in the Marina District. The sand boils covered uniformly the liquefied area that experienced lateral spreading and settlement.

  Abstract                 = {This work presents a statistical study on the effect of soil layers with uncertain properties on ground-motion intensity at the soil surface. Surface motion is obtained by applying multiple real rock earthquake records at the base of different characterizations of the soil column, each one generated via Monte Carlo simulation. The effect of the soil is studied in terms of a site-specific, frequency-dependent amplification function, $AF(f)$, where f is a generic oscillator frequency. The goal here is the identification of ground-motion parameters that allow an efficient prediction of $AF(f)$. We investigated magnitude, $M$, source-to-site distance, $R$, of the input bedrock accelerogram along with bedrock ground-motion parameters such as peak ground acceleration, $PGA_r$, and spectral acceleration values, $S_a^r(f)$ and $S_a^r(f_{sc})$, both at the generic frequency $f$ and at the specific initial fundamental frequency of vibration, $f_sc$ of the soil column. This work includes two case studies: a saturated sandy site and a saturated soft clayey site. In the former, loss of shear strength owing to cyclic mobility is anticipated for severe levels of ground shaking, while in the latter, significant amplification is expected at long oscillator periods. The results show that $S_a^r(f)$ of the input record is the single most helpful parameter for the prediction of $AF(f)$ at the same oscillator frequency, $f$. $S_a^r(f)$ is more informative than PGAr and/or the pair of $M$ and $R$ values of the event that generated the bedrock motion. A sufficiently accurate estimate of the median $AF(f)$ can be obtained by using 10 or fewer records, which may be selected without undue attention to the specific scenario events (i.e., $M$ and $R$ pairs) that control the hazard at the site. Finally, the effect of the uncertainty in the soil parameters on the prediction error of $AF(f)$ is of secondary importance compared to that from record-to-record variability. These findings will be used to estimate the hazard at the soil surface in a companion article in this issue (Bazzurro and Cornell, 2004).},

  Abstract                 = {This study presents effective probabilistic procedures for evaluating ground-motion hazard at the free-field surface of a nonlinear soil deposit located at a specific site. Ground motion at the surface, or at any depth of interest within the soil formation (e.g., at the structure foundation level), is defined here in terms either of a suite of oscillator-frequency-dependent hazard curves for spectral acceleration, [IMG]/medium/03216-eq001.gif" ALT="Formula ">, or of one or more spectral acceleration uniform-hazard spectra, each associated with a given mean return period. It is presumed that similar information is available for the rock-outcrop input. The effects of uncertainty in soil properties are directly included. This methodology incorporates the amplification of the local soil deposit into the framework of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). The soil amplification is characterized by a frequency-dependent amplification function, AF(f), where f is a generic oscillator frequency. AF(f) is defined as the ratio of [IMG]/medium/03216-eq002.gif" ALT="Formula "> to the spectral acceleration at the bedrock level, [IMG]/medium/03216-eq003.gif" ALT="Formula ">. The estimates of the statistics of the amplification function are obtained by a limited number of nonlinear dynamic analyses of the soil column with uncertain properties, as discussed in a companion article in this issue (Bazzurro and Cornell, 2004). The hazard at the soil surface (or at any desired depth) is computed by convolving the site-specific hazard curve at the bedrock level with the probability distribution of the amplification function. The approach presented here provides more precise surface ground-motion-hazard estimates than those found by means of standard attenuation laws for generic soil conditions. The use of generic ground-motion predictive equations may in fact lead to inaccurate results especially for soft-clay-soil sites, where considerable amplification is expected at long periods, and for saturated sandy sites, where high-intensity ground shaking may cause loss of shear strength owing to liquefaction or to cyclic mobility. Both such cases are considered in this article. In addition to the proposed procedure, two alternative, easier-to-implement but approximate techniques for obtaining hazard estimates at the soil surface are also briefly discussed. One is based on running a conventional PSHA with a rock-attenuation relationship modified to include the soil response, whereas the other consists of using a simple, analytical, closed-form solution that appropriately modifies the hazard results at the rock level.},

The database consists of 22 and 80 soil stations for the Loma Prieta and Whittier Narrows events, respectively. A statistically significant (at 95 percent confidence) reduction in amplification for the Loma Prieta event, within 40 km from the fault, is observed between approximately 1 and 3 Hz. Examining individual strong- to weak-motion amplifications as a function of peak acceleration at the base of soil, within this frequency range, shows that detectable reduction in amplification occurs at accelerations above about 200 cm/sec2. The strong-motion amplification is reduced by a factor of 1.7--2 on average, relative to a generic weak-motion response. The results of this study suggest the magnitude of the reduction in amplification, caused by soil nonlinearity at large strain, that can be expected on average at California soil sites.},

In predicting this effect for large future earthquakes, the linear elastic response of soils is customarily assumed. To check this assumption, we have analyzed surface and downhole acceleration data from the SMART1 and SMART2 strong motion arrays in Taiwan, covering peak accelerations of up to 0[middle dot]3 g. First, frequency-dependent amplification induced by the alluvial deposits at the SMART1 array was estimated using spectral ratio technique, where the records at rock site were taken as a reference motion. Statistically validated reduction in soil amplification in the strong motion relative to the weak motion in the frequency range between approximately 1 and 9 Hz was detected. Secondly, relative site responses between the Pleistocene and recent sedimentary deposits at the SMART2 array were studied. Relative amplification was shown to be clearly dependent on the excitation level. Thirdly, we compared experimentally recorded uphole/downhole spectral ratios on weak and strong ground motion with the theoretical response yielded by the geotechnical code DESRA2 which assumes hysteretic constitutive relationship of soil. Major symptoms of nonlinear ground behavior predicted by the model were found in the observed data. Back-calculation of the shear wave velocities to the depth of 47 m shows nearly 50 percent decrease in the strongest quakes, also accounted for by the nonlinear soil behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {The stochastic method of simulating ground motions from finite faults is validated against strong-motion data from the M 6.7 1994 Northridge, California, earthquake. The finite-fault plane is subdivided into elements, each element is assigned a stochastic {omega}2 spectrum, and the delayed contributions from all subfaults are summed in the time domain. Simulated horizontal acceleration time histories and Fourier spectra at 28 rock sites are compared with observations. We first perform simulations using the slip distribution on the causative fault derived from strong-motion, teleseismic, GPS, and leveling data (Wald et al., 1996). We then test the performance of the method using quasi-random distributions of slip and alternative hypocenter locations; this is important because the rupture initiation point and slip distribution are in general not known for future earthquakes. The model bias is calculated as the ratio of the simulated to the observed spectrum in the frequency band of 0.1 to 12.5 Hz, averaged over a suite of rock sites. The mean bias is within the 95% confidence limits of unity, showing that the model provides an accurate prediction of the spectral content of ground motions on average. The maximum excursion of the model bias from the unity value, when averaged over all 28 rock stations, is a factor of approximately 1.6; at most frequencies, it is below a factor of 1.4. Interestingly, the spectral bias and the standard deviation of the stochastic simulations do not depend on whether the fault slip distribution and hypocenter location are based on data or are randomly generated. This suggests that these parameters do not affect the accuracy of predicting the average characteristics of ground motion, or they may have their predominant effect in the frequency range below about 0.1 Hz (below the range of this study). The implication is that deterministic slip models are not necessary to produce reasonably accurate simulations of the spectral content of strong ground motions. This is fortunate, because such models are not available for forecasting motions from future earthquakes. However, the directivity effects controlled by the hypocenter location are important in determining peak ground acceleration at individual sites. Although the method is unbiased when averaged over all rock sites, the simulations at individual sites can have significant errors (generally a factor of 2 to 3), which are also frequency dependent. Factors such as local geology, site topography, or basin-propagation effects can profoundly affect the recordings at individual stations. To generate more accurate site-specific predictions, empirical responses at each site could be established.},

  Abstract                 = {On average, soil sites behaved nonlinearly during the M 6.7 1994 Northridge, California, earthquake. This conclusion follows from an analysis that combines elements of two independent lines of investigation. First, we apply the stochastic finite-fault simulation method, calibrated with 28 rock-site recordings of the Northridge mainshock, to the simulation of the input motions to the soil sites that recorded this event. The calibrated model has a near-zero average bias in reproducing ground motions at rock sites in the frequency range from 0.1 to 12.5 Hz.

The soil sites selected are those where there is colocation of strong-motion accelerographs and temporary instruments from the Northridge aftershock observation network. At these sites, weak-motion amplification functions based on numerous aftershock records have been empirically determined, in three separate investigations reported in the literature. These empirical weak-motion amplification factors can be applied to the simulated input rock motions, at each soil site, to determine the expected motions during the mainshock (i.e., neglecting nonlinearity). These expected motions can then be compared to the actual recordings during the mainshock.

This analysis shows that the recorded strong-motion spectra are significantly over-estimated if weak-motion amplifications are used. The null hypothesis, stating that the inferred differences between weak- and strong-motion amplifications are statistically insignificant, is rejected with 95 percent confidence in the frequency range from approximately 2.2 to 10 Hz. On average, the difference between weak- and strong-motion amplifications is a factor of 2. Nonlinear response at those soil stations for which the input peak acceleration exceeded 150 to 200 cm/sec${}^2$ contributes most to this observed average difference. These findings suggest a significant nonlinear response at soil stations in the Los Angeles urban area during the Northridge mainshock. The effect is consistent with the increase in damping of shear waves at high levels of strain, which is well known from geotechnical studies of soil properties.},

  Abstract                 = {The study of nonlinear site response has practical difficulties due to large ambiguities in isolating local response from other competing effects. We chose a sedimentary site LF6 in Los Angeles basin that (1) has the closest reference rock sites available, compared to other stations, allowing an accurate estimation of local amplification, and (2) illustrates clear resonance in the near surface. In our opinion, this case represents the least ambiguity in the identification of possible nonlinearity. The site responses during the Northridge, the 1987 Whittier Narrows events and the Northridge aftershocks are compared. The station shows a fundamental resonance-frequency change between the higher- and lower-amplitude motions in the entire ensemble of 17 events used. The net shear-modulus reduction during the Northridge event is a factor of 1.3 to 1.4 compared to the Whittier Narrows event and is a factor of 1.7 compared to the aftershocks. This result provides guidance of what to expect at other sites in the basin, where the nonlinear response is less easy to characterize.},

  Abstract                 = {Spectral ratios between soft soil and reference rock sites are often used to predict the sedimentary site response to earthquakes. However, their relationship with the genuine site-specific amplification function is often unclear. We compare the soil-to-rock spectral ratios between the stations that are 3.3 km apart with the ``genuine'' response given by the ratios between the surface and 17 and 47 m downhole. Data from the SMART1 array in Taiwan are used. The ``weak'' and ``strong'' motion records are addressed separately to allow for nonlinear soil response. The soil-to-rock spectral ratios are nearly identical to the "true" amplification at the frequencies from 1 to 10 Hz, if the finite depth of the borehole is taken into account. They correctly capture the strong-motion deamplification effect. However, the soil-to-rock spectral ratios are roughly 1.4 times more uncertain than surface-to-47-m ratios. In summary, the soil-to-rock spectral ratios can be considered as the reliable estimates of the real site response.},

Several tests are provided to verify the numerical performance of the method against Green's function solutions for homogeneous and piecewise homogeneous media, both with and without anelastic attenuation. A comparison is also provided against a finite difference code and an unstructured tetrahedral finite element code for a simulation of the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. The numerical tests all show very good agreement with analytical solutions and other codes. Finally, performance evaluation indicates excellent single-processor performance and parallel scalability over a range of 1 to 2048 processors for Northridge simulations with up to 300 million degrees of freedom.},

  Abstract                 = {This article reports on the development of a modular two-step, finite-element methodology for modeling earthquake ground motion in highly heterogeneous localized regions with large contrasts in wavelengths. We target complex geological structures such as sedimentary basins and ridges that are some distance away from the earthquake source. We overcome the problem of multiple physical scales by subdividing the original problem into two simpler ones. The first is an auxiliary problem that simulates the earthquake source and propagation path effects with a model that encompasses the source and a background structure from which the localized feature has been removed. The second problem models local site effects. Its input is a set of equivalent localized forces derived from the first step. These forces act only within a single layer of elements adjacent to the interface between the exterior region and the geological feature of interest. This enables us to reduce the domain size in the second step. If the background subsurface structure is simple, one can replace the finite-element method in the first step with an alternative efficient method. The methodology is illustrated in a companion paper (Yoshimura et al., 2003) for several 3D problems of increasing physical and computational complexity. We consider first a flat-layered, stratigraphic system. For this simple case, the first step can be carried out by means of 3D Green's function evaluations. The extension to more general problems is illustrated by two examples: a basin and a hill, with the same background stratigraphy. To verify the two-step procedure with a problem for which the finite-element method is used throughout, we model ground motion in a small region of the Los Angeles Basin, using both the two-step domain-reduction method and the traditional approach in which the computational domain contains both the source and the geological region of interest.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the numerical solution of time-harmonic transition problems in elasticity, in general, and with soil amplification in inhomogeneous alluvial valleys, in particular. A mixed variational formulation based on Hamilton's principle, involving field equations only within the valley and an integral representation for the surrounding medium, is developed and used to derive a symmetric finite element-boundary-element method for this problem. This method, valid for all frequencies, incorporates automatically the displacement and traction interface continuity conditions; therefore, it imposes no boundary constraints on the approximating functions. The BEM-FEM is applied to the response of semicircular inhomogeneous valleys with linearly increasing shear modulus with depth, due to oblique incident SH waves. Numerical results emphasize the importance of two-dimensional resonant effects in deep valleys, and the strong effects of varying stiffness on surface motion, including a rapid spatial variation, especially near valley edges. This can have practical implications in design as it suggests that it is possible for two similar structures located near each other to experience different levels of shaking and, thus, different damage levels during the same earthquake.},

  Abstract                 = {A theory is developed for the propagation of stress waves in a porous elastic solid containing compressible viscous fluid. The emphasis of the present treatment is on materials where fluid and solid are of comparable densities as for instance in the case of water-saturated rock. The paper denoted here as Part I is restricted to the lower frequency range where the assumption of Poiseuille flow is valid. The extension to the higher frequencies will be treated in Part II. It is found that the material may be described by four nondimensional parameters and a characteristic frequency. There are two dilatational waves and one rotational wave. The physical interpretation of the result is clarified by treating first the case where the fluid is frictionless. The case of a material containing viscous fluid is then developed and discussed numerically. Phase velocity dispersion curves and attenuation coefficients for the three types of waves are plotted as a function of the frequency for various combinations of the characteristic parameters.},

Artificial filling of a cove at the site of The Marina District proceeded gradually from the late 1860s to 1912, when major hydraulic filling was done for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. The remains of thousands of piles driven for the Exposition very probably still exist and have had unknown effects on long-term ground settlement and earthquake-related ground displacements. Intensity maps of the 1906 earthquake, and seismic recordings and severe building damage in 1989, reported by others, indicate that ground motion was amplified on both natural and artificial ground. This suggests that the configuration of the bedrock surface and the location and thickness of various clay and sand deposits underlying the fill had an important effect on the shaking. However, most of the settlement and liquefaction and the damage to pipelines, building foundations, streets, side-walks, and curbs occurred in areas of artificial fill consisting mainly of loose sand.},

This method of simulating ground motions often goes by the name "the stochastic method." It is particularly useful for simulating the higher-frequency ground motions of most interest to engineers (generally, f>0.1 Hz), and it is widely used to predict ground motions for regions of the world in which recordings of motion from potentially damaging earthquakes are not available. This simple method has been successful in matching a variety of ground-motion measures for earthquakes with seismic moments spanning more than 12 orders of magnitude and in diverse tectonic environments. One of the essential characteristics of the method is that it distills what is known about the various factors affecting ground motions (source, path, and site) into simple functional forms. This provides a means by which the results of the rigorous studies reported in other papers in this volume can be incorporated into practical predictions of ground motion.},

On this basis the method is extended to the problem of Love waves propagating across an ocean-continent type boundary. Numerical propagation of an initial transient solution results in seismograms at various distances. The Fourier transforms of these seismograms are used to calculate phase velocity, group delay, and amplitude-transfer coefficients for various seismometer combinations across the transition region. Some results are: the transition zone can have a small but noticeable effect on phase velocities measured between stations situated away from the zone; a phase-velocity anisotropy exists for waves propagating in opposite directions across the same array. In general, waves propagating into the region of thinning have anomalously high-phase velocities and vice versa. This is especially noticeable for velocities measured over the zone of transition, where the perturbations of the phase velocity of continent-to-ocean waves from the expected local phase velocity can exceed the variations expected from the continent-ocean structural differences. The behavior at a distance from the boundary justifies the well-established method of calculating effective group velocities by means of inverse averages of regional group velocities and also indicates a simple correction for the effect of the ocean-continent boundary that can be applied to calculations of earthquake-source mechanisms based on the method of amplitude equalization.},

These data together with recent site characterizations based on shear-wave velocity measurements provide empirical estimates of the site coefficients at base accelerations up to 0.5 g for Site Classes C and D. These empirical estimates of Fa and Fv as well as their decrease with increasing base acceleration level are consistent at the 95 percent confidence level with those in present building code provisions, with the exception of estimates for Fa at levels of 0.1 and 0.2 g, which are less than the lower confidence bound by amounts up to 13 percent. The site-coefficient estimates are consistent at the 95 percent confidence level with those of several other investigators for base accelerations greater than 0.3 g. These consistencies and present code procedures indicate that changes in the site coefficients are not warranted. Empirical results for base accelerations greater than 0.2 g confirm the need for both a short- and a mid- or long-period site coefficient to characterize site response for purposes of estimating site-specific design spectra.},

A stick model with the same spatial interpolation accuracy as a three-dimensional FE model is used for vertical wave propagation analysis. The constitutive model is based on a three-dimensional bounding surface plasticity theory with a vanishing elastic region, and accounts for shear stiffness degradation right at the onset of loading. The model is cast in a time-domain nonlinear FE code SPECTRA and is used to analyze the 1986 earthquake data. It is shown that the recorded downhole motion of Lotung was dominated by nonlinear response. Results of the fully nonlinear analysis are compared with the predictions of the program SHAKE so that the performance of the nonlinear model may be assessed relative to that of an equivalent linear model.},

The computation is carried out by the discrete wavenumber representation method (Bouchon, 1979). The resulting motion is almost purely horizontal throughout central and southern California, and, at most of the locations, the direction of severe ground shaking is oriented NE-SW. In the Los Angeles area, the peak displacement is about 30 cm, and the duration of severe ground motion is about 75 sec. Since our model does not include the effect of incoherent rupture propagation, our estimate should be considered as a lower bound. The simulated seismic motions are presented in the form of three-dimensional snapshots as well as in the usual form of time series at selected locations. The resultant near-field seismograms show a great diversity in the characteristic of motion as pointed out for actual near-field accelerograms by Hudson (1976). Our simulated motions appear to be in harmony with the description of the effect of the 1857 earthquake by contemporary accounts compiled by Agnew and Sieh (1978)},

  Abstract                 = {The Northridge, California, earthquake that strongly shook the city of Los Angeles in January 1994, produced one of the highest ground accelerations ever recorded in an earthquake, at a site located on top of a small hill in Tarzana, about 6 km south of the epicenter. The subsequent study of aftershock recordings obtained by a dense seismic array deployed on the hill a few days after the earthquake showed the existence of a strong amplification at stations located at the top of the hill, relative to stations near the base (Spudich et al., 1996). Resonances and polarization rotations were also observed. We investigate in this study the role that the topography of the site played on the observed ground motions and accelerations. To this aim, we perform numerical simulations and study the response of the three-dimensional topography of the site to incident shear waves polarized in different directions. The method used is a boundary integral equation scheme in which the Green's functions are calculated by the discrete wavenumber method. The results obtained show that the topography of the site, though quite gentle (the hill is less than 20-m high), strongly affects the ground motions in the frequency range between 2 and 15 Hz. Many of the observed characteristics of the seismic response at Tarzana are explained in part by its topography: the consistent amplification of ground motion at and near the top of the hill, the directional seismic response of the hill that results in a strong amplification of the ground motion transverse to the direction of elongation of the hill, the existence of a fundamental transverse oscillatory resonance mode of the hill at 3 to 5 Hz, the rotation of the polarization of ground motion, and the spatial variation of amplification over the hill at the fundamental resonance mode. The seismic response of the topography, however, does not fully explain the amplitude of the effects observed. The three-dimensional geological structure of the site must in some way amplify the effect of the topography to produce the observed seismic response. In spite of not being as strong as the observed effect, the topographic effect of the site is considerable. The ground motion is amplified by factors ranging from 30 percent to 100 percent at some locations in the frequency rangefrom 2 to 15 Hz. Rapid spatial variations of ground-shaking intensities can take place over distance scales of a few tens of meters at high frequency. Finally, the results of the simulation indicate that the topography of the site amplified the large east-west accelerations recorded there during the Northridge mainshock by 30 to 40 percent.},

We regard cities as a periodic distribution of simple oscillators. The response to a vertical incident SH wave is analyzed by considering the city with a macroscopic point of view. As a first approach, the effect of buildings is described by a mean impedance on the soil-city interface. This enables us to identify a mechanical soil-city coupling parameter that governs the magnitude of the interaction and to determine a characteristic time of the soil-city response. A second, more refined model based on approximated wave fields radiated by each building leads to introducing a boundary layer to describe the multiple interactions effect. This provides an assessment of both free soil motion and building basement motion. Applications are given for monofrequency and multifrequency cities in the case of homogeneous and stratified substratums.},

The proposed Vs as a function of Vp relations fit Vs and Vp borehole logs in Quaternary alluvium and Salinian granites as well as laboratory measurements over a 7-km/sec-wide range in Vp. The relations derived here are very close to those used to develop a regional 3D velocity model for southern California, based on pre-1970 data, and thus provide support for that model. These data, and these relations, show a rapid increase in Vs as Vp increases to 3.5 km/sec leading to higher shear-wave velocities in young sedimentary deposits than commonly assumed. These relations, appropriate for active continental margins where earthquakes are prone to occur, suggests that amplification of strong ground motions by shallow geologic deposits may not be as large as predicted by some earlier models.},

These rock types include the Jurassic and Cretaceous Franciscan Complex (metagraywacke and greenstones), serpentinites, Cretaceous Salinian and Sierra granites and granodiorites, Jurassic and Cretaceous Great Valley Sequence, and older Cenozoic sedimentary rocks (including the La Honda basin). Similar relations for less volumetrically important rocks are also developed for andesites, basalts, gabbros, and Sonoma Volcanics. For each rock type I summarize and plot the data used to develop the velocity versus depth relationships. These plots document the existing constraints on the proposed relationships. This report also presents a new empirical Vp versus depth relation derived from hundreds of measurements in USGS 30-m vertical seismic profiles (VSPs) for Holocene and Plio-Quaternary deposits in the San Francisco Bay area. For the upper 40 m (0.04 km) these mainly Holocene deposits, can be approximated by Vp (km/s) = 0.7 + 42.968z - 575.8z2 + 2931.6z3 - 3977.6z4, where z is depth in km. In addition, this report provides tables summarizing these VSP observations for the various types of Holocene and Plio-Quaternary deposits. In USGS Bay Area Velocity Model 05.0.0 these compressional wave velocity (Vp) versus depth relationships are converted to shear wave velocity (Vs) versus depth relationships using recently proposed empirical Vs versus Vp relations. Density is calculated from Vp using Gardner's rule and relations for crystalline rocks proposed by Christensen and Mooney (1995). Vs is then used to calculate intrinsic attenuation coefficients for shear and compressional waves, Qs and Qp, respectively.},

In this work we study the impact of a potential major earthquake on the San Andreas Fault with significant seismic hazard in the Greater Los Angeles Basin. We present results for the ShakeOut simulation---a rupture beginning near Salton Sea, California, heading 270 km northwest along the fault, that produces a Mw 7.8 earthquake in a geographical region which includes all major populated areas of Southern California and northern Mexico, in a 600 km by 300 km by 80 km volume, for a maximum frequency of 1.0 Hz and a minimum shear wave velocity of 200 m/s. For the material model, we use a discretized version of SCEC's CVM4 velocity model, called CVM-Etree. The simulation was performed at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center using Hercules, a finite element octree-based, parallel software developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie Mellon University. Hercules implements a highly efficient end-to-end algorithm for solving the wave field in highly heterogeneous media due to kinematic faulting. We verify our results by comparing synthetic seismograms computed with a parallel finite difference code by Robert Graves (URS) for a similar scenario earthquake, for a maximum frequency of 0.5 Hz and minimum shear wave velocity of 500 m/s. We focus our analysis of the results of the 1.0 Hz ShakeOut simulation on the Los Angeles Basin area, and the Santa Clara River Valley and Oxnard Plain. We examine the site effects present in these two areas and their proneness to capture and amplify seismic waves due to their geological features. Results show a direct correlation between the amplification levels and the local soil and basin profiles.}

This large intraplate event was located close to the coast and caused important damage in the state of Oaxaca. We modeled acceleration records from 10 strong-motion stations located near the rupture and at regional distances. The site response of the stations used was determined using more than 100 additional records from other events recorded at the sites of interest. We estimated average spectral ratios between horizontal and vertical components of ground motion (HVSR method), and we incorporated the site response estimates in the stochastic simulations. We also analyzed the decay of the observed spectral amplitudes with hypocentral distance and estimated the attenuation relation to be Qs = 416.5 f0.7. The main event had a normal-faulting mechanism with a fault plane 90 km long and 45 km wide. We divided the fault plane into 9 x 5 subfaults to apply the point-source formalism. Specific slip weights were prescribed on the individual subfaults using the slip distribution obtained by Hernandez et al. (2001). Then, we looked for values of the radiation-strength factor (sfact) and the stress parameter ({sigma}) that gave the minimum model bias of the acceleration response spectra. We found that sfact = 1 and{sigma} = 90 bars provided the best fit to the observed response spectra and peak ground acceleration (PGA). These results will be useful to estimate the regional PGA generated by earthquakes with similar source characteristics as the 30 September 1999 event.},

In comparison, the radiation of waves away from the soil--foundation interface has received little attention. Recent studies point out that SSI in an urban environment can modify the ground motion recorded in the free-field. These modifications will be important when two conditions are met: structures founded on soft soils and coincidence between the vibration periods of the structure and those of the superficial layers. Both conditions are met in Mexico City lake zone. In this study, we investigate SSI effects on `free-field' motion. The data we use consist of microtremors recorded on soft soils in Mexico City, a densely built environment. Our objective was to identify the modifications to free-field ground motion caused by neighbouring structures. Data were analysed using H/V spectral ratios. Large variations in the level of amplification and resonant frequency were determined from microtremors in very closely spaced stations. Our results suggest consistently that free-field ground motion is significantly affected by the presence of neighbouring structures.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a review of the application of the spectral-element method to regional and global seismology. This technique is a high-order variational method that allows one to compute accurate synthetic seismograms in three-dimensional heterogeneous Earth models with deformed geometry. We first recall the strong and weak forms of the seismic wave equation with a particular emphasis set on fluid regions. We then discuss in detail how the conditions that hold on the boundaries, including coupling boundaries, are honored. We briefly outline the spectral-element discretization procedure and present the time-marching algorithm that makes use of the diagonal structure of the mass matrix. We show examples that illustrate the capabilities of the method and its interest in the context of the computation of three-dimensional synthetic seismograms.},

  Abstract                 = {This article documents a comparative exercise for numerical simulation of ground motion, addressing the seismic response of the Grenoble site, a typical Alpine valley with complex 3D geometry and large velocity contrasts. Predictions up to 2 Hz were asked for four different structure wave-field configurations (point source and extended source, with and without surface topography). This effort is part of a larger exercise organized for the third international symposium on the effects of surface geology (ESG 2006), the complete results of which are reported elsewhere (Tsuno et al., 2009). While initial, blind computations significantly differed from one another, a remarkable fit was obtained after correcting for some nonmethodological errors for four 3D methods: the arbitrary high-order derivative discontinuous Galerkin method (ADER-DGM), the velocity-stress finite-difference scheme on an arbitrary discontinuous staggered grid (FDM), and two implementations of the spectral-element method (SEM1 and SEM2). Their basic formulation is briefly recalled, and their implementation for the Grenoble Valley and the corresponding requirements in terms of computer resources are detailed. Besides a visual inspection of PGV maps, more refined, quantitative comparisons based on time-frequency analysis greatly help in understanding the origin of differences, with a special emphasis on phase misfit. The match is found excellent below 1 Hz, and gradually deteriorates for increasing frequency, reflecting differences in meshing strategy, numerical dispersion, and implementation of damping properties. While the numerical prediction of ground motion cannot yet be considered a mature, push-button approach, the good agreement reached by four participants indicates that, when used properly, numerical simulation is actually able to handle correctly wave radiation from extended sources in complex 3D media. The main recommendation to obtain reliable numerical predictions of earthquake ground motion is to use at least two different but comparably accurate methods, for instance the present formulations and implementations of the FDM, SEM, and ADER-DGM.},

A relationship between maximum horizontal acceleration on soil versus maximum horizontal acceleration on rock is presented based on strong-motion recordings at free-field sites. The effect of geologic conditions on localized damage patterns is shown to be important for this earthquake, although many of the sites within the affected region are stiff soil sites classified as S1 or S2 sites by the UBC. The results of preliminary seismic site response analyses performed at two deep alluvial sites indicate that much of the observed site amplification can be captured by one-dimensional wave propagation analyses.},

  Abstract                 = {The seismic potential of southern China is associated with the collision between the Indian and the Eurasian plates. This is manifested in the western Sichuan Plateau by several seismically active systems of faults, such as the Longmen Shan. The seismicity observed on the Longmen Shan fault includes recent events with magnitudes of up to 6.5, and the one of 12 May 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. Herewith, as part of an ongoing research program, a recently optimized three-dimensional (3D) seismic wave propagation parallel finite-difference code was used to obtain low-frequency (less than equal 0.3 Hz) 3D synthetic seismograms for the Wenchuan earthquake. The code was run on KanBalam (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico) and HECToR (UK National Supercomputing Service) supercomputers. The modeling included the U.S. Geological Survey 40x315 km2 kinematic description of the earthquake's rupture, embedded in a 2400x1600x300 km3 physical domain, spatially discretized at 1 km in the three directions and a temporal discretization of 0.03 s. The compression and shear wave velocities and densities of the geologic structure used were obtained from recently published geophysical studies performed in the Sichuan region. The synthetic seismograms favorably compare with the observed ones for several station sites of the Seismological and Accelerographic Networks of China, such as MZQ, GYA, and TIY, located at about 90, 500, and 1200 km, respectively, from the epicenter of the Wenchuan event. Moreover, the comparisons of synthetic displacements with differential radar interferometry (DinSAR) ground deformation imagery, as well as of maximum velocity synthetic patterns with Mercalli modified intensity isoseist of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, are acceptable. 3D visualizations of the propagation of the event were also obtained; they show the source rupture directivity effects of the Mw 7.9 Wenchuan event. Our results partially explain the extensive damage observed on the infrastructure and towns located in the neighborhood of the Wenchuan earthquake rupture zone.},

  Abstract                 = {We apply full 3D tomography (f3dt) to a regional dataset in the Los Angeles area. In f3dt, the starting model as well as the model perturbation is three- dimensional and the sensitivity (Frechet) kernels are computed using numerical schemes that account for the full physics of 3D wave propagation. f3dt can account for the nonlinearity of structural inverse problem through iteration, thus providing the most efficient means for assimilating seismic observations into dynamic ground- motion models. We have successfully applied a scattering-integral (si) formulation of f3dt to improve a 3D elastic structure model, the Southern California Earthquake Center (scec) Community Velocity Model version 3.0 (CVM3.0) with lowest shear velocity clamped at 1 km/sec, in the Los Angeles region. Our data are time- and frequency-localized measurements of phase-delay anomalies relative to synthetics computed from the 3D elastic starting model. The Frechet kernels for our measurements were computed by convolving the earthquake wave fields generated by point earthquake sources with the receiver Green tensors (rgts), which are the spatial- temporal fields produced by three orthogonal unit impulsive point forces acting at the receiver locations. We inverted 7364 phase-delay measurements of P and S body waves by using the lsqr method. The revised 3D model, LAF3D, provides substantially better fit to the observed waveform data than the 3D starting model. To our knowledge, this study is the first successful application of f3dt using real data in structural seismology.},

  Abstract                 = {In dense urban areas, buildings are generally constructed in clusters, forming city blocks. New buildings are designed assuming their response is independent of adjacent buildings, which ignores potentially important structure-soil-structure-interaction (SSSI) effects. Although a few studies have revealed the significance of SSSI effects, validated simulation and design tools do not exist. In this paper, we present the results from the first in a series of centrifuge tests intended to investigate SSSI effects. Results herein are focused on the design and measured response of two model building-foundation systems placed on dense dry Nevada sand and tested at 55-g. The two models represent prototypical nine-story and three-story special moment resisting frame buildings, with the former structure supported by a three-level basement-mat and the later on isolated spread footings. Nonlinear response-history simulations are performed to aid in the design of the models, with particular attention to reproducing prototype building periods and nonlinear characteristics. Yielding of the model buildings is achieved using custom-designed fuses placed strategically throughout the superstructures. At present, the two models are placed as far apart as possible to characterize soil-structure interaction on individual buildings; subsequent experiments will move the structures in near proximity, allowing direct experimental assessment of structuresoil-structure-interaction.}

We first present a numerical method able to account for a three-dimensional building distribution resting on a layered elastic-half-space. The proposed method is based on a variational coupling between Boundary Elements and modal representation for the buildings. Provided with the hypothesis of a stochastic homogeneous distribution of these buildings or a deterministic periodic one, a realistic model of an entire city may be accounted for. This method is applied to practical situations and it is shown that modifications of the incident field occur mainly for soft layered soils. However from an engineering point of view, it appears that the amplification levels are not significantly modified even in these extreme cases. Nevertheless, a strong scattering of the response inside the city depends on the nearby buildings can be observed.},

From the theoretical point of view, the scattering cross-section of a vibrating building is first calculated from classical Soil-Structure I nteraction (SSI) framework. Using the image technique, the mean free path ` is approximated and compared to the wavelength in order to determine the wave propagation regime: single or multiple scattering. A numerical method is then used to investigate the seismic wave propagation in a random city in the strong multiple scattering regime. The city site effect is shown to play a significant role both on the mean response and on the fluctuations. Local resonance and very short correlation length of the scattered field with respect to the wavelength indicate a localization like regime.

  Abstract                 = {Earthquakes are among the most complex terrestrial phenomena, and modeling of earthquake dynamics is one of the most challenging computational problems in science. Computational capabilities have advanced to a state where we can perform wavefield simulations for realistic three-dimensional earth models, and gain more insights into the earthquakes that threaten California and many areas of the world. The Southern California Earthquake Center initiated a major earthquake research program called TeraShake to perform physics-based numerical simulations of earthquake processes for large geographical regions, at high resolution, and for high frequencies. For a large scale simulation such as TeraShake, optimization problems tend to emerge that are not significant in smaller scale simulations. This involves both large parallel computation and also massive data management and visualization coordination. In this paper, we describe how we performed single-processor optimization of the TeraShake AWM application, optimization of the I/O handling, and optimization of initialization. We also look at the challenges presented by run-time data archive management and visualization. The improvements made to the TeraShake AWM code enabled execution on the 40k IBM Blue Gene processors and have created a community code that can be used by seismologists to perform petascale earthquake simulations.},

The computational demands of this program continue to increase rapidly as these researchers seek to perform physics-based numerical simulations of earthquake processes for larger meet the needs of this research program, a multiple-institution team coordinated by SCEC has integrated several scientific codes into a numerical modeling-based research tool we call the TeraShake computational platform (TSCP). A central component in the TSCP is a highly scalable earthquake wave propagation simulation program called the TeraShake anelastic wave propagation (TS-AWP) code. In this chapter, we describe how we extended an existing, stand-alone, wellvalidated, finite-difference, anelastic wave propagation modeling code into the highly scalable and widely used TS-AWP and then integrated this code into the TeraShake computational platform that provides end-to-end (initialization to analysis) research capabilities. We also describe the techniques used to enhance the TS-AWP parallel performance on TeraGrid supercomputers, as well as the TeraShake simulations phases including input preparation, run time, data archive management, and visualization. As a result of our efforts to improve its parallel efficiency, the TS-AWP has now shown highly efficient strong scaling on over 40K processors on IBM's BlueGene/L Watson computer. In addition, the TSCP has developed into a computational system that is useful to many members of the SCEC community for performing large-scale earthquake simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {Petascale simulations are needed to understand the rupture and wave dynamics of the largest earthquakes at shaking frequencies required to engineer safe structures ( gt 1 Hz). Toward this goal, we have developed a highly scalable, parallel application (AWP-ODC) that has achieved ``M8'': a full dynamical simulation of a magnitude-8 earthquake on the southern San Andreas fault up to 2 Hz. M8 was calculated using a uniform mesh of 436 billion 40-m3 cubes to represent the three-dimensional crustal structure of Southern California, in a 800 km by 400 km area, home to over 20 million people. This production run producing 360 sec of wave propagation sustained 220 Tflop/s for 24 hours on NCCS Jaguar using 223,074 cores. As the largest-ever earthquake simulation, M8 opens new territory for earthquake science and engineering - the physics-based modeling of the largest seismic hazards with the goal of reducing their potential for loss of life and property.},

  Abstract                 = {Ground-motion recording obtaineds at the Van Norman Complex from the 1994 Northridge, California, mainshock and its aftershocks constitute an excellent data set for the analysis of soil response as a function of ground-motion amplitude. We searched for nonlinear response by comparing the Fourier spectral ratios of two pairs of sites for ground motions of different levels, using data from permanent strong-motion recorders and from specially deployed portable instruments. We also compared the amplitude dependence of the observed ratios with the amplitude dependence of the theoretical ratios obtained from 1-D linear and 1-D equivalent-linear transfer functions, using recently published borehole velocity profiles at the sites to provide the low-strain material properties. One pair of sites was at the Jensen Filtration Plant (JFP); the other pair was the Rinaldi Receiving Station (RIN) and the Los Angeles Dam (LAD). Most of the analysis was concentrated on the motions at the Jensen sites. Portable seismometers were installed at the JFP to see if the motions inside the structures housing the strong-motion recorders differed from nearby free-field motions. We recorded seven small earthquakes and found that the high-frequency, low-amplitude motions in the administration building were about 0.3 of those outside the building. This means that the lack of high frequencies on the strong-motion recordings in the administration building relative to the generator building is not due solely to nonlinear soil effects. After taking into account the effects of the buildings, however, analysis of the suite of strong- and weak-motion recordings indicates that nonlinearity occurred at the JFP. As predicted by equivalent-linear analysis, the largest events (the mainshock and the 20 March 1994 aftershock) show a significant deamplification of the high-frequency motion relative to the weak motions from aftershocks occurring many months after the mainshock. The weak-motion aftershocks recorded within 12 hours of the mainshock, however, show a relative deamplification similar to that in the mainshock. The soil behavior may be a consequence of a pore pressure buildup during large-amplitude motion that was not dissipated until sometime later. The motions at (RIN) and (LAD) are from free-field sites. The comparison among spectral ratios of the mainshock, weak-motion coda waves of the mainshock, and an aftershock within ten minutes of the mainshock indicate that some nonlinearity occurred, presumably at (RIN) because it is the softer site. The spectral ratio for the mainshock is between that calculated for pure linear response and that calculated from the equivalent-linear method, using commonly used modulus reduction and damping ratio curves. In contrast to the Jensen sites, the ratio of motions soon after the high-amplitude portion of the mainshock differs from the ratio of the mainshock motions, indicating the mechanical properties of the soil returned to the low-strain values as the high-amplitude motion ended. This may indicate a type of nonlinear soil response different from that affecting motion at the Jensen administration building.},

  Abstract                 = {The site response to strong and weak ground motion depends largely on the subsurface conditions at the soil site for the two rock-soil station pairs studied. The first station pair consists of a soft-soil site (Treasure Island) and a sandstone and shale site (Yerba Buena Island). These stations recorded strong ground shaking from the Loma Prieta mainshock and weak ground motion from four aftershocks. The range of peak ground acceleration is from approximately 0.00006 to 0.07 g at the rock site. Compared to the rock site, the strong ground motion at the soft-soil site is amplified by a factor of about 3 over a frequency range from 0.5 to 2.0 Hz. The amplification is much higher for weak motion and suggests a dependence on signal amplitude. For example, near 1 Hz, the site response shows an increasing amplification as magnitude (and the peak velocity at the rock site) decreases. For events of local magnitude 7.0, 4.3, 4.1, 3.5, and 3.3, the maximum soil-site amplifications are 4, 12, 17, 19, and 25, respectively. A second station pair consisting of a stiff-soil site (Gilroy #2) and a sandstone site (Gilroy #1) was also studied with contrasting results. These two stations recorded strong ground shaking from the 1979 Coyote Lake, 1984 Morgan Hill, and 1989 Loma Prieta mainshocks. Weak ground motion was recorded at these stations after the Loma Prieta mainshock. The range of peak ground acceleration is from 0.006 to 0.43 g at the rock site. Unlike the results for the soft-soil study above, the estimated stiff-soil site responses are not significantly different for strong and weak motion from 0.5 to 2.0 Hz. Near 0.7 Hz, the stiff-soil site responses range from 2.5 to 4.5 for strong ground shaking from three mainshocks and from 1.5 to 4.0 for weak ground shaking from thirteen aftershocks.},

The North Dike underwent a noticeable increase in seepage, without significantly impeding normal reservoir operations. The Northridge Earthquake uplifted and shifted the foundation of the LAR by 30 cm, and provided us with a unique example of tectonic effects on embankments. In contrast to the LAR, which performed well, the nearby rolled fill dike of the Power Plant Tailrace slowly failed by piping due to transverse cracks and differential lateral spreading induced by liquefaction.

  Abstract                 = {Realistic anelastic attenuation can be incorporated rigorously into finite difference and other numerical wave propagation methods using internal or memory variables. The main impediment to the realistic treatment of anelastic attenuation in 3D is the very large computational storage requirement imposed by the additional variables. We previously proposed an alternative to the conventional memory-variable formulation, the method of coarse-grain memory variables, and demonstrated its effectiveness in acoustic problems. We generalize this memory-efficient formulation to 3D anelasticity and describe a fourth-order, staggered-grid finite-difference implementation. The anelastic coarse-grain method applied to plane wave propagation successfully simulates frequency-independent Qp and Qs. Apparent Q values are constant to within 4 percent tolerance over approximately two decades in frequency and biased less than 4 percent from specified target values. This performance is comparable to that achieved previously for acoustic-wave propagation, and accuracy could be further improved by optimizing the memory-variable relaxation times and weights. For a given assignment of relaxation times and weights, the coarse-grain method provides an eight-fold reduction in the storage requirement for memory variables, relative to the conventional approach. The method closely approximates the wavenumber-integration solution for the response of an anelastic half-space to a shallow dislocation source, accurately calculating all phases including the surface-diffracted SP phase and the Rayleigh wave. The half-space test demonstrates that the wave field-averaging concept underlying the coarse-grain method is effective near boundaries and in the presence of evanescent waves. We anticipate that this method will also be applicable to unstructured grid methods, such as the finite-element method and the spectral-element method, although additional numerical testing will be required to establish accuracy in the presence of grid irregularity. The method is not effective at wavelengths equal to and shorter than 4 grid cell dimensions, where it produces anomalous scattering effects. This limitation could be significant for very high-order numerical schemes under some circumstances (i.e., whenever wave-lengths as short as 4 grids are otherwise within the usable bandwidth of the scheme), but it is of no practical importance in our fourth-order finite-difference implementation.},

  Abstract                 = {An investigation was made to determine the feasibility of isolating the effects of site conditions on strong earthquake accelerograms. The set of accelerograms recorded simultaneously in 1952 at the roof, in the basement and on the ground outside the 14-story Hollywood Storage Building was chosen for analysis. Fourier spectra were computed for the two horizontal components at each of the three recording places and were used after smoothing to compute the ratios of spectra for adjacent points. Dynamic models of the subsurface conditions, the foundation and the building were established. Certain of the spectral ratios were also determined theoretically.The primary result is the development of a method of isolating effects of site conditions in Fourier spectra of accelerograms. Good theoretical checks were obtained on soil-structure interaction and structural response in the east-west direction. The absence of bedrock accelerograms prevented the obtaining of a theoretical check on free-field amplification, although plausible bedrock Fourier spectra were obtained. The subsurface model should be useful for further analyses.},

Stiffness and strength degradation of this material may be specified as a function of accumulated plastic strain and associated pore-pressure build-up. The entire numerical procedure may be executed on a personal computer and consequently qualifies as a versatile tool in conducting preliminary design calculations or parametric-type investigations.

  Abstract                 = {Seismic downhole-array data provide a unique source of information on actual soil (and overall site) behavior over a wide range of loading conditions that are not readily covered by in-situ or laboratory experimentation procedures. In this paper, free-field downhole-array seismic records are employed to identify and model the recorded response at the Lotung (Taiwan) and Treasure Island (California) sites. At Lotung, a five-accelerometer array recorded the site response during 18 earthquakes (1985-1986). The Treasure Island site was instrumented in 1992 with an array of six accelerometers that recorded a low amplitude earthquake in 1993. Using this downhole data, correlation and spectral analyses are performed to evaluate shear wave propagation characteristics, variation of shear wave velocity with depth and site resonant frequencies and model configurations. In addition, the actual seismic shear stress-strain histories are directly evaluated from the recorded downhole accelerations. These histories provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of site amplification, damping and pore-pressure build-up. Computational simulations of these case histories are performed based on the identified mechanisms of site response. In a companion paper, two additional case histories of site liquefaction are analyzed using records of downhole seismic response.},

  Abstract                 = {The Big Ten project is generating a hierarchy of simulations for ten of the most probable large ($M > 7$) ruptures in Southern California, with the objective of understanding how source directivity, rupture complexity, and basin effects control ground motions. The ruptures and moment-magnitudes are selected from events with relatively high probability rates in the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, Version 2 (UCERF2) model. The event set is being used to coordinate multiple types of large-scale simulations (requiring high performance computing), as well as multiple groups of researchers around a common set of earthquake scenarios. The geoscience goals of the Big Ten project are to: (1) Understand the roles of source directivity, rupture complexity, and basin effects on ground motions, and evaluate how these factors control hazard curves from the CyberShake project; (2) Improve simulation capabilities by incorporating new codes that can model geologic complexities including topography, geologic discontinuities, and source complexities such as irregular, dipping, and offset faults; (3) Use dynamic rupture simulations to investigate the effects of realistic friction laws, geologic heterogeneities, and near-fault stress states on seismic radiation and thereby improve pseudo-dynamic rupture models of hazardous earthquakes; and (4) Use realistic earthquake simulations to evaluate static and dynamic stress transfer and assess their effects on strain accumulation, rupture nucleation, and stress release. Examples of some preliminary Big Ten simulations will be presented.}

  Abstract                 = {An explicit finite difference code, ELWA, has been developed for solving a three-dimensional (3D) formulation of the damped elastic wave equation for a soil medium in the time domain. The code was implemented on a 8K processors massively data-parallel computer. In this paper, a description is given of the mathematical model forming the basis for the code as well as of its application towards explaining the occurrence of extreme ground and structural vibrations during a rock concert in Gothenburg, Sweden.
During two rock concerts held at a large outdoor stadium in Gothenburg, in the summer of 1985, the part of the audience standing on the pitch in front of the stage started to jump in time to the music. This rhythmic jumping caused the soil deposit below to vibrate heavily, leading to severe vibration in the flexible superstructure of the stadium. The vibrations became so severe in the upper parts of the stands that the audience left their places. Residents in the neighbourhood of the stadium complained of heavy vibrations in their respective residences.

A model of the soil medium under the stadium arena is described along with the excitation forces used to model audience behaviour when listening to rhythmic and excitable music. Using ELWA, an analysis of soil vibrations for these conditions shows that the reflection of vibrations from the solid rock underlying the clay deposit upon, which the stadium is based, causes standing waves to arise at the associated resonant frequencies. These waves will be transmitted to the stadium superstructure through soil-foundation interaction. The most important parameters controlling the wave amplitude were found to be the thickness of the clay deposit and the frequency of loading.},

Violent vibration levels occurred in the ground and a part of the audience observed considerable motion in the structure. Based on finite element analysis, it is concluded that the underlying soft clay of the structure was excited with the same frequency as the beat of the music. The whole clay deposit under the stadium started, therefore, to vibrate with great variations in amplitudes over the field due to the complex geometry. Through interaction with the basement of the structure as well as its deep foundation the waves were transmitted to the superstructure. Parts of the structure framework have natural frequencies close to those of the beat. Consequently they started to vibrate violently.},

Despite the simplifications introduced, results for a number of different soil profiles and material description parameters are in good agreement with those given by numerical simulation techniques.

  Abstract                 = {Earthquake ground motions are needed to evaluate the seismic performance of new and existing structures and facilities. In seismically active regions the strong ground motion recordings database is usually sufficiently large to physically constrain the earthquake estimation for seismic risk assessment. However, in areas of low seismicity rate, particularly in the Central and Eastern United States, the estimation of strong ground motions for a specified magnitude, distance, and site conditions represents a significant issue. The only available approach for ground motion estimation in this region is numerical simulation.

In this study, earthquake ground motions have been generated for the Upper Mississippi Embayment using a numerical wave propagation formulation. The effects of epistemic and aleatory uncertainties in the earthquake source, path, and site processes, the effect of non-linear soil behavior, and the effects of the geometry of the Embayment have been incorporated. The ground motions are intended to better characterize the seismic hazard in the Upper Mississippi Embayment by representing the amplitude and variability that might be observed in real earthquakes and to provide resources to evaluate the seismic risk in the region.},

  Abstract                 = {The main objective of this study is to examine, by means of computational simulation, how earthquake ground motion in an urban region is affected by the presence of multiple building structures, and conversely, how interaction between an individual structure and the surrounding soil and between multiple structures affects structural response during earthquakes. The analysis is based on the Domain Reduction Method (DRM), a modular two-step finite element methodology for modeling earthquake ground motion in highly heterogeneous localized regions. To illustrate the interaction effects, we use an idealized scenario that resembles in a simplified fashion the geological setting of the Mexico City basin and the effects of an earthquake generated some distance away from the basin. A city-like environment, comprised of a set of eighty eight, interacting, 0.5 to 2.0 Hz, simple oscillators with different types of foundations is included in the model. The simplified structures are placed over a soft and dipping clay layer underlain by sands and rock. The results for these scenario earthquakes indicate the occurrence of significant amounts of spatially distributed ground motion, even for relatively small areas of just hundreds of meters. In addition, the dynamic effects generated by the constructed infrastructure alter the way in which seismic waves propagate, and therefore modify the nature of the free field ground motion in and around the vicinity of the urban region. Conversely, the structural response of the individual building models is significantly affected by SSI and structure-to-structure interaction (STSI), resulting in reductions or increases of the response on the order of up to 70 percent with respect to that of the corresponding non-interacting structures. Moreover, same order differences are observed on the response of identical structures that are located at different sites.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been known since at least 1898 (ref. 1) that sediments can amplify earthquake ground motion relative to bedrock. For the weak ground motion accompanying small earthquakes, the amplification due to sediments is well understood in terms of linear elasticity (Hooke's law)2, but there has been a long-standing debate regarding the amplification associated with the strong ground motion produced by large earthquakes. The view of geotechnical engineers, based largely on laboratory studies, is that Hooke's law breaks down at larger strains causing a reduced (nonlinear) amplification. Seismologists, on the other hand, have tended to remain sceptical of this nonlinear effect, mainly because the relatively few strong-motion observations seemed to be consistent with linear elasticity. Although some recent earthquake studies have demonstrated nonlinear behaviour under certain circumstances3,4, the significance of nonlinearity for the type of stiff-soil sites found in the greater Los Angeles region remains unresolved5. Here we report that ground-motion amplification due to sediments for the main shock of the 1994 Northridge earthquake was up to a factor of two less than the amplification observed for its aftershocks. These observations imply significant nonlinearity in such amplification, and bring into question the use of measurements of weak ground motion to predict the strong ground motion at sedimentary sites.},

  Abstract                 = {We have addressed the long-standing question regarding nonlinear sediment response in the Los Angeles region by testing whether sediment amplification was similar between the Northridge earthquake and its aftershocks. Comparing the weak- and strong-motion site response at 15 sediment sites, we find that amplification factors were significantly less for the main shock implying systematic nonlinearity. The difference is largest between 2 and 4 Hz (a factor of 2), and is significant at the 99 percent confidence level between 0.8 and 5.5 Hz. The inference of nonlinearity is robust with respect to the removal of possibly anomalous sediment sites and how the reference-site motion is defined. Furthermore, theoretical ground-motion simulations show no evidence of any bias from finite source effects during the main shock. Nonlinearity is also suggested by the fact that the four sediment sites that contain a clear fundamental resonance for the weak motion exhibit a conspicuous absence of the peak in the strong motion. Although we have taken the first step of establishing the presence of nonlinearity, it remains to define the physics of nonlinear response and to test the methodologies presently applied routinely in engineering practice. The inference of nonlinearity implies that care must be exercised in using sediment site data to study large earthquakes or predict strong ground motion.},

  Abstract                 = {Three-dimensional finite difference simulations of elastic waves in the San Bernardino Valley were performed for two hypothetical earthquakes on the San Andreas fault: a point source with moment magnitude M5 and an extended rupture with M6.5. A method is presented for incorporating a source with arbitrary focal mechanism in the grid. Synthetics from the 3-D simulations are compared with those derived from 2-D (vertical cross section) and 1-D (flat-layered) models. The synthetic seismograms from the 3-D and 2-D simulations exhibit large surface waves produced by conversion of incident S waves at the edge of the basin. Seismograms from the flat-layered model do not contain these converted surface waves and underestimate the duration of shaking. The seismograms from the 3-D simulations have larger amplitude coda than do the seismograms from the 2-D case because of the presence of off-azimuth surface wave arrivals in the 3-D simulations that are not included in the 2-D simulations. Snapshots of the wavefield of the 3-D simulation show that these off-azimuth arrivals represent surface waves reflected from the edges of the basin. The anelastic attenuation of the sediments is a key parameter controlling the overall duration of motion. Some of the coda energy at rock sites near the basin edges represents leakage of surface wave energy out of the basin. For the M6.5 earthquake simulation, the largest ground velocities occur where surface waves reflected from the edge of the basin interfere constructively with the trapped waves that follow the direct S-wave. Maps of maximum ground velocity are produced for two directions of rupture propagation. The largest velocities occur in localized portions of the basin. The location of the largest velocities changes with the rupture propagation direction. Contours of maximum shaking are also dependent on asperity positions and radiation pattern.},

  Abstract                 = {We used the 3D finite-difference method to model observed seismograms of two earthquakes (ML 4.9 and 3.5) in the Seattle region and to simulate ground motions for hypothetical M 6.5 and M 5.0 earthquakes on the Seattle fault, for periods greater than 2 sec. A 3D velocity model of the Seattle Basin was constructed from studies that analyzed seismic-reflection surveys, borehole logs, and gravity and aeromagnetic data. The observations and the simulations highlight the importance of the Seattle Basin on long-period ground motions. For earthquakes occurring just south of the basin, the edge of the basin and the variation of the thickness of the Quaternary deposits in the basin produce much larger surface waves than expected from flat-layered models. The data consist of seismograms recorded by instruments deployed in Seattle by the USGS and the University of Washington (UW). The 3D simulation reproduces the peak amplitude and duration of most of the seismograms of the June 1997 Bremerton event (ML 4.9) recorded in Seattle. We found the focal mechanism for this event that best fits the observed seismograms in Seattle by combining Green's functions determined from the 3D simulations for the six fundamental moment couples. The February 1997 event (ML 3.5) to the south of the Seattle Basin exhibits a large surface-wave arrival at UW whose amplitude is matched by the synthetics in our 3D velocity model, for a source depth of 9 km. The M 6.5 simulations incorporated a fractal slip distribution on the fault plane. These simulations produced the largest ground motions in an area that includes downtown Seattle. This is mainly caused by rupture directed up dip toward downtown, radiation pattern of the source, and the turning of S waves by the velocity gradient in the Seattle basin. Another area of high ground motion is located about 13 km north of the fault and is caused by an increase in the amplitude of higher-mode Rayleigh waves caused by the thinning of the Quaternary deposits.},

  Abstract                 = {The finite-difference method is used to propagate elastic waves through a 3-D model of the Santa Clara Valley, an alluvium-filled basin that underlies the city of San Jose, California. The model was based on depth to bedrock information from water wells in the area. The simulation corresponded to a region 30 (east-west) by 22 (north-south) by 6 (depth) km and contained about 4 million grid points. Synthetic seismograms from the simulation are accurate at frequencies up to 1 Hz. Motions from a magnitude 4.4 aftershock of the Loma Prieta earthquake were modeled. Snapshots of ground motion and synthetic seismograms from the simulation are presented. The simulation illustrates S-to-surface-wave conversion at the edges of the basin and the large amplitude and long duration of ground motion in the basin compared to the surrounding rock. Love waves produced at the edge of the basin are the largest arrivals in the transverse synthetics. Because of the slow group velocity of the Love waves, sites near the center of the basin have longer durations of significant motions than basin sites near the valley edges. Sites near the center of the basin also show larger peak amplitudes on the transverse component. Array analysis of the synthetic seismograms indicates that Love waves tend to propagate parallel to the eastern and western edges of the valley. Rayleigh waves are produced along the southern margin of the basin from incident S waves. Large radial motions occur where a Rayleigh wave impinges on the northeast margin of the valley. Some Rayleigh waves travel westward across the basin, after being scattered from the eastern edge of the valley. Synthetic seismograms from the simulation have similar peak amplitudes as seismograms recorded by the Sunnyvale dense array for this aftershock, although the duration of the tranverse component is not matched by the synthetic seismogram, using this basin model. The simulation indicates that the Love waves observed on the actual seismograms were produced by conversion of incident S waves at the southern margin of the Santa Clara Valley. 2-D simulations show how the S-to-Love-wave conversion is affected by the angle of incidence of the S wave and the sharpness of the velocity transition between the alluvium and bedrock. As more accurate basin models are developed, 3-D simulations should become valuable for predicting ground motions in sedimentary basins for future large earthquakes.},

  Abstract                 = {We demonstrate the usefulness of physics-based integrated simulation of subduction earthquakes for making strong-motion predictions in a deterministic way. We estimated strong ground motions caused by a 2003 Tokachi-oki-like earthquake, taking into account the stress accumulation due to tectonic loading, dynamic rupture propagation due to the failure of asperities, and generation of strong ground motions. Then we compared the synthetic seismograms with those observed during the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake (M 8.0) to confirm that simple but physically reasonable modeling can obtain a reasonable estimate of ground motions of large earthquakes in view of peak ground velocities, duration, and velocity response spectra. It should be emphasized that this procedure is quite important to constructing a physics-based earthquake generation model that would be available for the prediction of strong ground motions and mitigation of disasters due to future large earthquakes. And this feature will not be achieved by traditional experience-based kinematic modeling approaches. Of course, this simulation includes quite a few uncertain parameters, but the parameter search experiment itself will help us construct useful scenarios of possible disasters we will suffer in the future. Hypocenter location is one of the most uncertain parameters in this simulation. We investigated the effect of uncertainty of hypocenter location on the computed strong motions quantitatively. The result shows that the variation in response spectra of ground velocities is within a factor of 2 at 3.3 sec and a factor of 4 at 15 sec, which is not serious compared to the local site amplification effects.},

Due to the staggered grid, the closest distance between the free surface and some wave-field components for both implementations is 1/2-grid spacing. Overall, the differences in accuracy of the two implementations are small. When compared to a reflectivity solution computed at the staggered positions closest to the surface, the total misfit for all three components of the wave field is generally found to be larger for the free surface colocated with the normal stresses, compared to that for the free surface colocated with the xz and yz stresses. However, this trend is reversed when compared to the reflectivity solution exactly at the free surface (the misfit encountered in staggered-grid modeling). When the wave field is averaged across the free surface, thereby centering the staggered wave field exactly on the free surface, the free-surface condition colocated with the xz and yz stresses generates the smallest total misfit for increasing epicentral distance. For an epicentral distance/hypocentral depth of 10, the total misfit of this condition is about 15 percent smaller than that for the condition colocated with the normal stresses, mainly controlled by the misfit on the Rayleigh wave.},

  Abstract                 = {The 2001 Big Bear Lake earthquake (Mw 4.63) was recorded by over 30 strong-motion instruments in the San Bernardino basin region of southern California. At periods longer than about 1 sec, the ground motions in the central portion of the basin have significantly larger amplitudes and extended durations of strong shaking relative to sites outside the basin. In many cases, the peak motions at the basin sites occur 10 or more seconds after the direct S-wave arrival, suggesting that these arrivals are controlled by basin-generated surface waves. To model these motions, I have performed finite-difference simulations using a 3D representation of the basin velocity structure. The basin structure has a minimum shear velocity of 250 m/sec, which coupled with the model grid spacing of 50 m yields a bandwidth resolution limit of T>1 sec for the numerical simulations. The simulations do quite well at reproducing the observed waveforms, amplitudes, and durations at periods of 3 sec and longer. At shorter periods (12 sec), the fit to the recorded motions is less well resolved, especially in matching the waveforms of the later-arriving phases. This suggests that in regions of complex geology, deterministic waveform modeling at periods approaching 1 sec involves more than simply reducing the minimum velocity threshold and, in particular, requires knowledge of the subsurface structure and distribution of seismic velocities at relatively short length scales (on the order of 50 m).},

  Abstract                 = {Olsen et al. (1995) recently simulated an Mw 7.75 earthquake on the San Andreas fault, predicting long-period (T > 2.5 sec) ground velocities of 140 cm/sec in the Los Angeles basin, about 60 km from the fault. These motions are much larger than estimates derived from empirical relations or other numerical simulations. Standard area-magnitude relations predict that the 170 x 16 km fault used in the simulations would produce an Mw 7.5 earthquake, giving a moment of 2.0 x 1027 dyne-cm, which is 2.4 times smaller than the moment used by Olsen et al. (1995). Further, self-similar scaling predicts a rise time of 3 sec for an Mw 7.75 event and 2.2 sec for an Mw 7.5 event. The filtered impulse slip function used by Olsen et al. (1995) has an effective rise time of 1.6 sec, yielding a response that is about 2 times larger than expected for periods less than 5 sec. This combination of high seismic moment and short rise time, along with the use of a uniform slip distribution, leads to the extreme ground-motion levels predicted by Olsen et al. (1995). To quantify the sensitivity of the long-period ground-motion response to source parameterization, we have performed 3D finite-difference (FD) simulations using various combinations of seismic moment, source rise time, and slip heterogeneity. These calculations incorporate the same grid dimensions, fault size, and bandwidth employed by Olsen et al. (1995). With a moment of 2.0 x 1027 dyne-cm, a rise time of 2 sec, and a smoothly heterogeneous slip distribution, we simulate peak long-period ground velocities of 155 cm/sec in the near-fault region and 40 cm/sec in the Los Angeles basin. These values are much closer to (although still higher than) empirical predictions. A uniform slip distribution produces the largest peak motions, both in the near-fault region and in the Los Angeles basin, whereas a rough asperity slip distribution noticeably reduces the maximum near-fault ground velocities. Our results indicate that the accurate simulation of long-period ground motions requires a realistic source parameterization, including appropriate choices of seismic moment and rise time, as well as the use of spatial and temporal variations in slip distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {This article provides an overview of the application of the staggered-grid finite-difference technique to model wave propagation problems in 3D elastic media. In addition to presenting generalized, discrete representations of the differential equations of motion using the staggered-grid approach, we also provide detailed formulations that describe the incorporation of moment-tensor sources, the implementation of a stable and accurate representation of a planar free-surface boundary for 3D models, and the derivation and implementation of an approximate technique to model spatially variable anelastic attenuation within time-domain finite-difference computations. The comparison of results obtained using the staggered-grid technique with those obtained using a frequency-wavenumber algorithm shows excellent agreement between the two methods for a variety of models. In addition, this article also introduces a memory optimization procedure that allows large-scale 3D finite-difference problems to be computed on a conventional, single-processor desktop workstation. With this technique, model storage is accommodated using both external (hard-disk) and internal (core) memory. To reduce system overhead, a cascaded time update procedure is utilized to maximize the number of computations performed between I/O operations. This formulation greatly expands the applicability of the 3D finite-difference technique by providing an efficient and practical algorithm for implementation on commonly available workstation platforms.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyze the stability and accuracy of the coarse-grain memory variable technique used for viscoelastic wave-field simulations. Our analysis shows that the general behavior of the coarse-grain system is well described by effective parameters (ME and QE) that are derived from the harmonic average of the moduli over the volume of the coarse-grain cell. The use of these effective parameters proves essential for analyzing the performance and accuracy of the coarse-grain system for Q values less than about 20. A necessary stability condition for the coarse-grain system requires that the weighting coefficients be bounded between 0 and 1. Specifying the weights using the approach of Day and Bradley (2001) satisfies this condition for Q values of about 3 and larger; however, using unconstrained optimization techniques will often produce weights that violate this condition at much higher Q values. We also derive a variation of the original coarse-grain methodology called the element-specific modulus (ESM) formulation in which each element of the coarse-grain cell uses a different unrelaxed modulus. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the coarse-grain system for Q values lower than about 20 is significantly improved with the ESM formulation without increasing the computational cost. Finally, we present a technique for optimizing the accuracy of the coarse-grain system for very low Q based on the use of the effective quality factor (QE). We demonstrate that using conventional optimization techniques that do not employ the effective parameter QE will actually degrade the accuracy of the coarse-grain system.},

  Abstract                 = {During the Mw 7.1 Hector Mine earthquake, peak ground velocities recorded at sites in the central San Bernardino basin region were up to 2 times larger and had significantly longer durations of strong shaking than sites just outside the basin. To better understand the effects of 3D structure on the long-period ground-motion response in this region, we have performed finite-difference simulations for this earthquake. The simulations are numerically accurate for periods of 2 sec and longer and incorporate the detailed spatial and temporal heterogeneity of source rupture, as well as complex 3D basin structure. Here, we analyze three models of the San Bernardino basin: model A (with structural constraints from gravity and seismic reflection data), model F (water well and seismic refraction data), and the Southern California Earthquake Center version 3 model (hydrologic and seismic refraction data). Models A and F are characterized by a gradual increase in sediment thickness toward the south with an abrupt step-up in the basement surface across the San Jacinto fault. The basin structure in the SCEC version 3 model has a nearly uniform sediment thickness of 1 km with little basement topography along the San Jacinto fault. In models A and F, we impose a layered velocity structure within the sediments based on the seismic refraction data and an assumed depth-dependent Vp/Vs ratio. Sediment velocities within the SCEC version 3 model are given by a smoothly varying rule-based function that is calibrated to the seismic refraction measurements. Due to computational limitations, the minimum shear-wave velocity is fixed at 600 m/sec in all of the models. Ground-motion simulations for both models A and F provide a reasonably good match to the amplitude and waveform characteristics of the recorded motions. In these models, surface waves are generated as energy enters the basin through the gradually sloping northern margin. Due to the basement step along the San Jacinto fault, the surface wave energy is confined to the region north of this structure, consistent with the observations. The SCEC version 3 model, lacking the basin geometry complexity present in the other two models, fails to provide a satisfactory match to the characteristics of the observed motions. Our study demonstrates the importance of using detailed and accurate basin geometry for predicting ground motions and also highlights the utility of integrating geological, geophysical, and seismological observations in the development and validation of 3D velocity models.},

The results of a theoretical analysis, appealing to a space2013frequency mode-matching (MM) technique, are compared to those obtained by a space2013time finite-element (FE) technique. The two methods are shown to give rise to the same prediction of the seismic response for Nb= 1, 2 and 40 blocks. The mechanism of the interaction between blocks and the ground, as well as that of the mutual interaction between blocks, are studied. It is shown, in the first part of this paper, that the presence of a small number of blocks modifies the seismic disturbance in a manner which evokes qualitatively, but not quantitatively, what was observed during the 1985 Michoacan earthquake in Mexico City. Anomalous earthquake response at a much greater level, in terms of duration, peak and cumulative amplitude of motion, is shown, by a theoretical and numerical analysis in the second part of this paper, to be induced by the presence of a large (226510) number of identical equi-spaced blocks that are present in certain districts of many cities.},

The first experiment was performed to study the motion of the structure excited by two small earthquakes. For one month, six strong-motion recorders were installed within the structure, at the top and at the basement. The analysis of the deformation of the structure has been assessed by computing the spectral ratio between the top and the bottom, with a special focus on soilstructure interaction. An analytical model was then proposed to reproduce the structure and soil-structure system behaviour. The soil-structure interaction was accounted for by using impedance functions. During the second experiment, we concentrated our efforts on the effect of the building vibration on the surface ground motion. An explosive shot was fired and several strong-motion recorders were installed on the ground close to the structure that allowed us to clearly identify a monochromatic wave coming from the building, in the time and frequency domains. This experiment allows us to demonstrate the non-negligible effect of the soil-structure-soil interaction that may disturb the surrounding ground motion.}

Most seismic risk analysis considers the buildings as a passive constituent integrated into the vulnerability analysis. This approach neglects the possible contribution of the building vibration to the free field. This article describes an analysis of site-city effects, that is, the seismic interaction of the city with soft soil layers. An analytic method derived from soil-structure interaction studies is described and applied to the Roma Norte zone of Mexico City. The building parameters are derived from detailed studies of the JA and PC buildings. The soil-city system is subjected to the Mexican (Mw 7.3) 14 September 1995 earthquake. The simulated ground surface motions, which incorporate the wave field radiated from the buildings of Roma Norte district, are compared to seismic records from this zone. Analytical procedures reproduce the long time duration and beating of the observed ground motion in Mexico City. Parametric analysis are also performed to identify the predominant factors (e.g., urbanization density, soil-to-city stiffness ratio) that favor the site-city interaction effects. A simple relation is proposed to estimate the expected efficiency of the site-city interaction effects for any city.},

  Abstract                 = {Effects of vibrating structure on the free-field motion are presented through a field experiment at the Euro-Seistest and a corresponding numerical simulation. Ground motion has been recorded by a dense temporary three-component (3C), two-dimensional (2D) seismic network installed at increasing distances from a model building forced into vibration by pull-out tests. The building is a five-story RC structure at a one-third scale, resting on the soil through surface square footing. A traction force, F0, applied at the building top and suddenly released forced it into vibrations. Two sequences of a pull-out test (POT) have been performed, each one made of two vibration tests in the two horizontal directions of the building (longitudinal and transverse).

The experimental data are then compared to the results of the numerical simulation. The soil-structure system is modeled by a three degree of freedom (3DOF) system. The soil-structure interaction (SSI) is accounted for through the help of impedance functions, and the motion induced by POT are estimated together with the base force and moment developed at the soil-structure interface. By representing the base forces by surface point seismic sources, the induced wavefield radiated in the surrounding free field is then computed by numerical Green's functions. The results presented here do validate the numerical computation method, which gave distant motions in close relation with the experimental data, from a qualitative and quantitative point of view. The spectral analysis does also exhibit surface waves trapped in the topmost layer. Results confirm the significant contamination of ground motion due to building vibration.},

The simulation utilizes the smaller events as Green's functions for the elements of a larger fault. Comparison of the simulated peak acceleration and duration with the data from the Parkfield earthquake is very good. Simulation of three earthquakes, M = 5.5, 6.5, and 7.0 indicate that the slope of the peak acceleration versus distance curve ({Delta} = 5 to 25 km) flattens, for strike-slip earthquakes, as the magnitude increases.},

Over an area of several hundred square kilometers in the near-source region, flexible frame and base-isolated buildings would experience severe nonlinear behavior including the possibility of collapse at some locations. The susceptibility of welded connections to fracture significantly increases the collapse potential of steel-frame buildings under strong ground motions of the type resulting from the Mw7.0 simulation. Because collapse of a building depends on many factors which are poorly understood, the results presented here regarding collapse should be interpreted carefully.},

  Abstract                 = {The basis of this study is the acceleration, velocity, and displacement wave-forms of the Loma Prieta earthquake (18 October 1989; M = 7.0) at two rock sites in San Francisco, a rock site on Yerba Buena Island, an artificial-fill site on Treasure Island, and three sites in Oakland underlain by thick sections of poorly consolidated Pleistocene sediments. The waveforms at the three rock sites display a strong coherence, as do the three sedimentary sites in Oakland. The duration of strong motion at the rock sites is very brief, suggestive of an unusually short source duration for an earthquake of this size, while the records in Oakland show strong amplification effects due to site geology. The S-wave group at Treasure Island is phase coherent with the Oakland records, but at somewhat diminished amplitudes, until the steps in acceleration at approximately 15 sec, apparently signaling the onset of liquefaction. All seven records clearly show shear-wave first motion opposite to that expected for the mainshock radiation pattern and peak amplitudes greater than expected for sites at these distances (95 {+/-} 3 km) from an earthquake of this magnitude. While the association between these ground motion records and related damage patterns in nearby areas has been easily and eagerly accepted by seismological and engineering observers of them, we have had some difficulty in making such relationships quantitative or even just clear. The three Oakland records, from sites that form a nearly equilateral triangle about the Cypress Street viaduct collapse, are dominated by a long-period resonance ([~=] 1 1/2-sec period) far removed from the natural frequency of the structure to transverse motion (2.5 Hz) or from high-frequency amplification bands observed in aftershock studies. A spectral ratio arbiter of this discrepancy confuses it further. The failure of the East Bay crossing of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge cannot be attributed to relative displacements of the abutments in Oakland and Yerba Buena Island, but the motions of the Bay Bridge causing failure remain unknown. The steps in acceleration at Treasure Island present unusual strong-motion accelerogram processing problems, and modeling suggests that the velocity and displacement waveforms are contaminated by a spurious response of the filtering operations to the acceleration steps. A variety of coincidences suggests that the Treasure island accelerogram is the most likely strong-motion surrogate for the filled areas of the Marina District, for which no mainshock records are available, but the relative contributions of bad ground, poor construction and truly strong ground motion to damage in the Marina District will never by known in any quantitative way. The principal lesson of all of this is that until a concerted effort is mounted to instrument ground and structures that are likely to fail during earthquakes, our understanding of the very complex relationships between strong ground motion and earthquake damage will, in general, remain rudimentary, imprecise, and vague.},

  Abstract                 = {Mathematical models of soil nonlinearity in common use and recently developed nonlinear codes are compared to investigate the range of their predictions. We consider equivalent linear formulations with and without frequency-dependent moduli and damping ratios and nonlinear formulations for total and effective stress. Average velocity profiles to 150 m depth with midrange National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program site classifications (B, BC, C, D, and E) in the top 30 m are used to compare the response of a wide range of site conditions from rock to soft soil. Nonlinear soil models are compared using the amplification spectrum, calculated as the ratio of surface ground motion to the input motion at the base of the velocity profile. Peak input motions from 0.1g to 0.9g are considered. For site class B, no significant differences exist between the models considered in this article. For site classes BC and C, differences are small at low input motions (0.1g to 0.2g), but become significant at higher input levels. For site classes D and E the overdamping of frequencies above about 4 Hz by the equivalent linear solution with frequency-independent parameters is apparent for the entire range of input motions considered. The equivalent linear formulation with frequency-dependent moduli and damping ratios under damps relative to the nonlinear models considered for site class C with larger input motions and most input levels for site classes D and E. At larger input motions the underdamping for site classes D and E is not as severe as the overdamping with the frequency-independent formulation, but there are still significant differences in the time domain. A nonlinear formulation is recommended for site classes D and E and for site classes BC and C with input motions greater than a few tenths of the acceleration of gravity. The type of nonlinear formulation to use is driven by considerations of the importance of water content and the availability of laboratory soils data. Our average amplification curves from a nonlinear effective stress formulation compare favorably with observed spectral amplification at class D and E sites in the Seattle area for the 2001 Nisqually earthquake.},

  Abstract                 = {This article compares techniques for calculating broadband time histories of ground motion in the near field of a finite fault by comparing synthetics with the strong-motion data set for the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Based on this comparison, a preferred methodology is presented. Ground-motion-simulation techniques are divided into two general methods: kinematic- and composite-fault models. Green's functions of three types are evaluated: stochastic, empirical, and theoretical. A hybrid scheme is found to give the best fit to the Northridge data. Low frequencies (< 1 Hz) are calculated using a kinematic-fault model and a 3D finite-difference code to propagate energy through a realistic 3D velocity structure. High frequencies (> 1 Hz) are calculated using a composite-fault model with a fractal subevent size distribution and stochastic, bandlimited, white-noise Green's functions. At frequencies below 1 Hz, theoretical elastic-wave-propagation synthetics introduce proper seismic-phase arrivals of body waves and surface waves. The 3D velocity structure more accurately reproduces record durations for the deep sedimentary basin structures found in the Los Angeles region. At frequencies above 1 Hz, scattering effects become important and wave propagation is more accurately represented by stochastic Green's functions. A fractal subevent size distribution for the composite fault model ensures an {omega}-2 spectral shape over the entire frequency band considered (0.1-20 Hz).},

  Abstract                 = {A 3D seismic velocity and attenuation model is developed for Santa Clara Valley, California, and its surrounding uplands to predict ground motions from scenario earthquakes. The model is developed using a variety of geologic and geophysical data. Our starting point is a 3D geologic model developed primarily from geologic mapping and gravity and magnetic surveys. An initial velocity model is constructed by using seismic velocities from boreholes, reflection/refraction lines, and spatial autocorrelation microtremor surveys. This model is further refined and the seismic attenuation is estimated through waveform modeling of weak motions from small local events and strong-ground motion from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Waveforms are calculated to an upper frequency of 1 Hz using a parallelized finite-difference code that utilizes two regions with a factor of 3 difference in grid spacing to reduce memory requirements. Cenozoic basins trap and strongly amplify ground motions. This effect is particularly strong in the Evergreen Basin on the northeastern side of the Santa Clara Valley, where the steeply dipping Silver Creek fault forms the southwestern boundary of the basin. In comparison, the Cupertino Basin on the southwestern side of the valley has a more moderate response, which is attributed to a greater age and velocity of the Cenozoic fill. Surface waves play a major role in the ground motion of sedimentary basins, and they are seen to strongly develop along the western margins of the Santa Clara Valley for our simulation of the Loma Prieta earthquake.},

  Abstract                 = {The Seattle fault poses a significant seismic hazard to the city of Seattle, Washington. A hybrid, low-frequency, high-frequency method is used to calculate broadband (0-20 Hz) ground-motion time histories for a M 6.5 earthquake on the Seattle fault. Low frequencies (<1 Hz) are calculated using a deterministic approach and finite difference in a 3D velocity model. High frequencies (>1 Hz) are calculated by a stochastic method that uses a fractal subevent size distribution to give an {omega}-2 displacement spectrum. Time histories are calculated for a grid of stations and then corrected for the local site response using a classification scheme based on the surficial geology. Average shear-wave velocity profiles are developed for six surficial geologic units: artificial fill, modified land, Esperance sand, Lawton clay, till, and Tertiary sandstone. These profiles together with other soil parameters are used to compare linear, equivalent-linear, and nonlinear predictions of ground motion in the frequency band 0-15 Hz. Linear site-response corrections are found to yield unreasonably large ground motions. Equivalent-linear and nonlinear calculations give peak values similar to the 1994 Northridge, California, earthquake and those predicted by regression relationships. Ground-motion variance is estimated for (1) randomization of the velocity profiles, (2) variation in source parameters, and (3) choice of nonlinear model. Within the limits of the models tested, the results are found to be most sensitive to the nonlinear model and soil parameters, notably the overconsolidation ratio.},

  Abstract                 = {We use P and S arrival times from 5225 earthquakes and 53 explosions, recorded by the Southern California Seismographic Network, to invert for the three-dimensional P- velocity (VP ) and the P and S-velocity ratio (VP / VS ) in the central Transverse Ranges and the Los Angeles basin. To model long-wavelength features of the velocity structure, we invert for the models by interpolating models determined successively from a sparse, medium, to a dense grid, with 40, 20, and 10 km spacing of horizontal grid nodes. Layers of grid nodes are placed at depths of 1, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 20 km. The data variance decreased about 80 percent in the gradational inversion. Ample data from the 1994 Northridge and other earthquake sequences, the rich background seismicity, and the dense station distribution along with controlled sources made the model well resolved, except along the edges, to the southwest in the offshore region, and at depths greater than 20 km. The VP model images the shape of the Los Angeles and east Ventura basins down to depths of 8 and 12 km. Three low-velocity areas at 1 km depth in the Los Angeles basin that coincide with recent sediment depositional areas are also imaged. The north edge of the Peninsular Ranges, the Santa Monica, and the San Gabriel Mountains, form discontinuous high-velocity ridges extending to depths of 20 km. The high VP /VS ratios in the near surface are consistent with high pore fluid pressures in the basin sediments. At depth beneath the east Ventura basin the high VP /VS and high VP suggest the presence of ophiolitic assemblages or mid-Miocene volcanics. In contrast, a body with normal VP and low VP /VS that is identified in the upper crust beneath Santa Monica Bay may be a fragment of quartz-rich continental crust. The VP model of both the Ventura and the Los Angeles basins shows features that suggest deformation of the hanging wall or basin closure. At seismogenic depths of 16 km the hypocenters of moderate-sized and large earthquakes are located within or adjacent to high-VP -velocity bodies. In most cases these high-velocity bodies form the upper block, consistent with shortening of the lower crust as described in thick-skinned tectonic interpretations.},

  Abstract                 = {The 3-D surface wave Boundary Element Method is applied to the same set of strong motion records as those of Part 1 (Kato et al., 1993), namely, the long-period strong motion with periods around 8 sec recorded at the JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency) stations in Yokohama and Tokyo during the 1980 Izu-hanto-toho-oki earthquake. This method simulates exact Love and Rayleigh waves in a laterally heterogeneous medium including 3-D basin structures. The needed computer memory and CPU time are made manageable by assuming the inside and outside of the basin to consist of horizontal flat layers. In addition, vertical interfaces are assumed between the basin and the outside bedrock for simplicity in this study. After checking the range of validity of the flat-layer approximation for the Kanto sedimentary basin, the generation and propagation of surface waves in the basin are numerically investigated. In particular, our investigation places special emphasis on the cause of the observed long duration, which could not be explained in Part 1 using the surface wave Gaussian Beam method. When the bedrock outside the western margin of the Kanto basin is incorporated into the model, the observed long duration at the Tokyo station is successfully reproduced. This can be explained by the strong surface waves generated by the surface wave to surface wave conversion at the margin and appearing in Tokyo after the direct surface waves from the epicenter. This result agrees with Kinoshita et al. (1992), who studied records from an array of seismographs in Tokyo. Moreover, when a sedimentary basin of Sagami Bay is included as was done in Part 1, the simulations are greatly improved, particularly at the Yokohama station, which corresponds to the node in the radiation pattern of the source. This is due to the fact that the radiation pattern is strongly affected by the near-source heterogeneity of the Sagami basin. All these results, together with direct comparisons to 2-D modelings, clearly show the strong 3-D effects of the basin structures on the generation and propagation of surface waves for this earthquake.},

  Title                    = {A Theoretical Method for Computing Near-Fault Ground Motions in Layered Half-Spaces Considering Static Offset Due to Surface Faulting, with a Physical Interpretation of Fling Step and Rupture Directivity},

  Abstract                 = {An efficient mathematical method is presented for computing the near-fault strong ground motions in a layered half-space, giving explicit consideration to the static offset due to surface faulting. In addition, the combined effects of ``fling step'' and ``rupture directivity'' on the near-fault ground motions are investigated. First, after checking the fault integration in the representation theorem, it is found that when an observation point is close to the fault plane, Green's functions exhibit near singularities, which consist of extremely sharp peaks in a narrow band close to the observation point. Therefore, direct numerical integration becomes quite onerous for computing near-fault ground motions, because the dynamic Green's functions must then be distributed very densely in order to evaluate accurately the effects of the near singularities. Instead, a new form of the representation theorem is introduced, which exploits the property that the dynamic Green's functions can be approximated by the corresponding static Green's functions in the vicinity of the singularities. The modified theorem, which involves the device of adding and subtracting the static Green's functions from the dynamic ones, is the sum of two fault integrations. The first integration involves the difference of the dynamic and the corresponding static Green's functions, while the second contains only the static Green's functions. This formulation requires much less CPU time than the original one when near-fault ground motions are considered, because the near singularities of the dynamic Green's functions in the first integration are completely eliminated by subtracting the static Green's functions. While the second integration does require a densely distributed set of points to capture the near-singular behavior of the static Green's function, it needs to be performed only once, as it is valid for all frequencies. Subtraction of the static Green's functions from the dynamic functions has the added benefit of making the integration over the wavenumber in the determination of the Green's functions much more efficient, especially for surface faulting. This is because the difference of the dynamic and static integrands converges rapidly to zero with increasing wavenumbers, whereas the original integrands diverge in the case of a source point on the free surface. The proposed methodology is used to investigate the two most important effects in near-fault ground motions, fling step (e.g., Abrahamson, 2001) and rupture directivity (e.g., Somerville et al., 1997), by paying special attention to the contribution of static and dynamic Green's functions. It is found that the fling effects stem mainly from the second integral in the modified representation theorem, which involves the static Green's function. The fling effects are dominant in the slip direction only in the vicinity of the surface fault and are negligible for buried faults, because the static Green's function attenuates rapidly with distance from the fault, r, as the order of (1/r2). Also, more importantly, when an observation point is located above a buried fault, the medium has to remain continuous, and thus cannot ``fling.'' By contrast, the directivity effects stem mainly from the first integral, which involves the dynamic Green's function, and attenuate much more slowly than the fling, on the order from 1/r to 1/sqrt(r). The directivity effects are dominant in the fault-normal direction, especiallyin the forward rupture direction, not only for the surface fault, but also for the buried fault. Due to the combined effects of fling and directivity in the vicinity of the surface fault, the directions of the maximum velocities and displacements are inclined with respect to the fault plane. On the other hand, when softer surface layers are added to the medium, the directivity effects become more significant than the fling effects, because the dynamic Green's functions are more pronounced than the static ones.},

Relative responses at 10 of these same stations as measured for small earthquakes by standard Wood-Anderson torsion seismometers are available for comparison from a study made by Gutenberg in the 1950's. Frequency spectra of strong ground motions as calculated for four sites having time-recording accelerographs assist in the interpretation of seismoscope results at the other stations. Attempts to correlate local distributions with known features of local geology such as thickness of alluvium, distance from known faults, etc., indicate that no single feature plays a dominant role in the resulting patterns. The implications of such complicated distributions for the preparation of seismic risk maps are discussed, and it is concluded that it would not be possible in the present state of knowledge to assess meaningful variations in the seismic risk throughout the Pasadena area.},

For resolving this problem, this paper applies the finite element method with voxel element to numerical simulation tools after some numerical verification. To reproduce complicated material properties of surface soft deposits, fundamental hysteresis attenuation is implemented in the three-dimensional simulation code. The proposed method is verified by carrying out the strong motion prediction with MMAM and comparing with measured data.

Similar long-range effects were also observed during the 2004 earthquake off Kii Peninsula, Japan. In this study, we present the results of simulations of these earthquakes undertaken using the finite element method (FEM) with a voxel mesh. In addition, to examine whether the 1906 San Francisco earthquake excited long-period ground motions in the Los Angeles-area basins, we performed long-period ground motion simulations of most of the California region. The FEM simulations confirmed the importance of path effects for the development of long-period ground motions.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a generalized method for simulating strong ground motion from large earthquakes by summing subevent records to follow the omega2 law. The original idea of the method is based on a constant stress parameter between the target event and the subevent. It is applicable to a case where both events have a different stress drop after some manipulation. However, the simulation for a very large earthquake from a small event with this method has inevitably some deficiencies of spectral amplitudes in the intermediate frequency range deviating from the omega2 model, although the high and low frequency motions match the scaling. We improve the simulation algorithm so as not to make spectral sags, introducing self-similar distribution of subfaults with different sizes in the fault plane, so-called fractal composite faulting model. We show successful simulations for intermediate-sized earthquakes (MJMA = 5.0, 6.0 and 6.1), the large aftershocks of the 1983 Akita-Oki earthquake. using the records of smaller aftershocks (MJMA = 3.9 and 5.0) as an empirical Green's function. Further, we attempted to estimate strong ground motion for the 1946 Nankai earthquake with Mw 8.2, using the records of a MJMA 5.1 earthquake occurring near the source region of the mainshock. We found that strong ground motions simulated for the fractal composite faulting model with two asperities radiating significantly high frequency motions matched well the observed data such as the near-field displacement record, the source spectrum estimated from the teleseismic record, and the seismic intensity distribution during the 1946 Nankai earthquake.},

  Abstract                 = {This study deals with the effects of the built environment on the earthquake ground motion, and with how individual buildings interact with the surrounding soil and with each other. We conduct a parametric study using Hercules, the parallel octree-based finite element earthquake simulator developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie Mellon University. Because of the necessity of performing repeated ground motion simulations , our analysis is based on the Domain Reduction Method (DRM), a modular two-step finite element methodology for modeling earthquake ground motion in highly heterogeneous localized regions. Buildings are included by modifying Hercules' finite-element meshing routines so that they are incorporated as additional block elements that are adjusted to emulate the general geometric and dynamic characteristics of buildings in city-like arrangements. We conduct our study in the greater Los Angeles basin using the main shock of 1994 Northridge earthquake for frequencies up to 2 Hz and a domain size of 85x85x42.5 km3 as the first step of the DRM. Then, we reduce the size of the region to a small subdomain of 2x2x1 km3 within the downtown Los Angeles region and introduce the building structures, for the second step of the DRM, in order to perform the repeated simulations of the parametric study.},

Later it was learned that the vertical component of the motion also was recorded by the seismograph on Mt. Wilson, 6.7 miles from the Library and 4,800 ft higher in elevation. The magnitude of the acceleration varied from 2.04 x 10-2g at the excitation level on the ninth floor of the building to 3.2 x 10-7g at Mt. Wilson.

  Abstract                 = {In this study of the dynamics of building-soil interaction, the soil is modeled by a linear elastic half-space, and the building structure by an n-degree-of-freedom oscillator. Both earthquake response and steady-state response to sinusoidal excitation are examined. By assuming that the interaction system possesses n+2 significant resonant frequencies, the response of the system is reduced to the superposition of the responses of damped linear oscillators subjected to modified excitations. The results are valid even though the interaction systems do not possess classical normal modes. For the special cases of single-story systems and the first modes of n-story systems, simplified approximate formulas are developed for the modified natural frequency and damping ratio and for the modified excitation. Example calculations are carried out by the approximate and more exact analysis for one-story, two-story and ten-story interaction systems. The results show that interaction tends to decrease all resonant frequencies, but that the effects are often significant only for the fundamental mode for many n-story structures and are more pronounced for rocking than for translation. If the fixed-base structure has damping, the effects of interaction on the earthquake responses are not always conservative, and an increase or decrease in the response can occur, depending on the parameters of the system.},

  Abstract                 = {The Volvi basin (northern Greece) is a 5-km-wide graben of Neogene age. It has been chosen by European Union (Directorate General XII for Science, Research and Development in Climatology and Natural Hazards) as a test site (EURO-SEISTEST) for studying site effects in one of Europe's most seismic active areas. The site is located in the epicentral area of the 1978, Ms = 6.5, earthquake that struck the city of Thessaloniki. The geometry, velocity, and stratigraphy of the basin were not well known. Consequently, a number of geophysical and geotechnical studies were performed to determine the 2D geometry and the dynamic characteristics (Vp, Vs, Qs) of the valley. Investigations included 78 refraction tests, 20 surface-wave inversions, and 8 borehole seismic tests as well as geotechnical tests. This article presents the methodology used for the geophysical investigation and the results. In its center, the graben depth reaches 190 m, and at least four normal faults have been located along the section. The overall graben structure and the fault locations have been confirmed by the records of a shot generated at one edge of the valley and by the measurements of a local earthquake. Wave propagation appears to be strongly influenced by the thickness of the sediments, which in turn is controlled by fault displacements. Simple 2D modeling of the basin response was performed, and the results are in good agreement with weak-motion data, confirming the validity of the seismic structure inferred from seismic prospecting.},

  Abstract                 = {A method is presented for calculating the seismic response of a system of horizontal soil layers. The essential element of the method is a rheological model suggested by Iwan which takes account of the nonlinear hysteretic behavior of soils and has considerable flexibility for incorporating laboratory results on the dynamic behavior of soils. Finite rigidity is allowed in the underlying elastic medium, permitting energy to be radiated back into the underlying medium. Three alternate ways of integrating the equations of motion are compared, an implicit technique, an explicit technique, and integration along characteristics. An example is set up for comparing the different methods of integration and for comparing the nonlinear solution with a solution based on the widely used equivalent linear assumption. The example consists of a 200 m section of firm alluvium excited at its base by the N21E component of the Taft accelerogram multiplied by four to produce a peak acceleration of 0.7 g and a peak velocity of 67 cm/sec. The three techniques of integration give very similar results, but integration along characteristics has the advantage of avoiding spurious high-frequency oscillations in the acceleration time history at the surface. For the chosen example, which has a thick soil column and a strong input motion, the equivalent linear solution underestimates the intensity of surface motion for periods between 0.1 and 0.6 sec by factors exceeding two. The discrepancies, however, would probably be less for input motion of lower intensity. At longer periods the equivalent linear solution is in essential agreement with the nonlinear solution. For the same example both solutions show that, compared to a site with rock at the surface, motion at the surface of the soil is amplified for periods longer than 1.5 sec by as much as a factor of two. At shorter periods the amplitude is reduced.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new numerical approach to solve the elastic wave equation in heterogeneous media in the presence of externally given source terms with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on unstructured triangular meshes. We combine a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with the ideas of the ADER time integration approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives. The time integration is performed via the so-called Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure using repeatedly the governing partial differential equation itself. In contrast to classical finite element methods we allow for discontinuities of the piecewise polynomial approximation of the solution at element interfaces. This way, we can use the well-established theory of fluxes across element interfaces based on the solution of Riemann problems as developed in the finite volume framework. In particular, we replace time derivatives in the Taylor expansion of the time integration procedure by space derivatives to obtain a numerical scheme of the same high order in space and time using only one single explicit step to evolve the solution from one time level to another. The method is specially suited for linear hyperbolic systems such as the heterogeneous elastic wave equations and allows an efficient implementation. We consider continuous sources in space and time and point sources characterized by a Delta distribution in space and some continuous source time function. Hereby, the method is able to deal with point sources at any position in the computational domain that does not necessarily need to coincide with a mesh point. Interpolation is automatically performed by evaluation of test functions at the source locations. The convergence analysis demonstrates that very high accuracy is retained even on strongly irregular meshes and by increasing the order of the ADER-DG schemes computational time and storage space can be reduced remarkably. Applications of the proposed method to Lamb's Problem, a problem of strong material heterogeneities and to an example of global seismic wave propagation finally confirm its accuracy, robustness and high flexibility.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a numerical study of the effects of geometrically complicated 3-D ruptures on near-source ground motions. In most of the kinematic and dynamic rupture modelling studies or seismic moment tensor and slip inversions the strong assumption of a perfectly planar fault is made. However, it is known from geological field studies that real fault traces are not planar but characterized by relatively strong deflections, bends and other irregularities. In this paper we, investigate the effects of such non-planar earthquake ruptures on ground motion modelling in comparison to their equivalent planar ones. For this purpose we apply the highly accurate Discontinuous Galerkin method that is capable of incorporating the geometry of complicated non-planar rupture surfaces by a set of double couple point sources that do not have to coincide with the mesh vertices. We generate a set of kinematic rupture models characterized by random spatial deflections with various correlation lengths and root mean square values. These deflections then determine the associated spatial strike and dip variations. We find that the deflected rupture models have the same seismic moment tensor as the perfectly planar one, however, with a reduced scalar moment, which we correct for. After a sound validation of our modelling approach, we present the effects of the deflections on synthetic velocity seismograms computed in the vicinity of the rupture. We observe that these geometrical irregularities do not just lead to high frequency effects but can strongly affect the synthetics in the whole frequency band. Finally, we discuss our observations in detail and conclude that the correct incorporation of the geometrical properties such as local strike and dip variations of the rupture surface is an important issue. We also discuss possible implications for some seismological fields, such as strong-motion simulations or seismic moment tensor and slip inversions, where these results might have significant consequences.},

  Abstract                 = {The 1995 Hyogo-Ken Nanbu earthquake struck the heavily populated Kobe and adjacent cities in western Japan. More than 6400 people were killed, and more than 150,000 buildings were destroyed. The characteristics of mainshock ground motions in the heavily damaged area are needed to understand how buildings and bridges performed and why they reached failure. Unfortunately, very few strong ground motions were recorded in the heavily damaged area during the mainshock. In this study, we attempt to estimate mainshock ground motions by using the empirical Green's function method (EGF method). First, we assume an initial source model with the asperities based on the rupture process obtained by inversion of strong-ground-motion records. For simplicity, we consider each asperity as a subevent with uniform stress drop in a finite extent. Then, the initial model was improved by matching the synthetic and observed ground motions using a trial-and-error procedure. The final model consists of three subevents: subevent 1 with stress drop of 163 bars, under the Akashi Strait around the rupture starting point; subevent 2 with stress drop of 86 bars, under the Nojima Fault in Awaji Island; and subevent 3 with stress drop of 86 bars, under Kobe. Finally, we estimate strong ground motions using aftershock records at sites where the mainshock was not recorded. The near-source motions in Kobe synthesized with the best-fit model are characterized by two large pulses with a duration of 1 to 3 sec. The pulses are caused by forward rupture directivity effects from subevents 1 and 3. Peak horizontal acceleration and velocity of the synthesized motions at the heavily damaged sites are about 1000 cm/sec2 and 130 cm/sec, respectively, while those at a rock site in the near-source region are about 300 cm/sec2 and 60 cm/sec.},

The long-period motions from the small events are deterministically calculated using the 3D finite-difference method, whereas the high-frequency motions from them are stochastically simulated using Boore's method. The small-event motions are synthesized summing the long-period and short-period motions after passing them through a pair of matched filters to follow the omega-squared source model. We call the resultant time series "hybrid Green's functions" (HGF). Ground motions from a large earthquake are simulated by following the empirical Green's function (EGF) method.

  Abstract                 = {Buildings damaged by the Whittier Narrows, California, earthquake of 1 October 1987 were concentrated in several areas, most of which were located 8 to 10 km from the epicenter (corresponding to the critical incidence for SV waves) and were near topographic irregularities, such as the northern part of Whittier, just south of Puente Hills. The purpose of this study is to show the possibility that this anomalous damage pattern is due to the amplification by the topographic irregularity when SV waves are near-critical incidence. First we examined the accelerograms obtained at the USGS station (7215 Bright Ave.) nearest to downtown Whittier and conclude that the dominantly eastwest motion observed at the station is due to the influence of the building in which accelerograms were recorded. We next demonstrate that strong ground motions recorded by 12 stations in the epicentral area show a polarization direction pattern that is primarily SV-type, which is consistent with a simple thrust fault located at the hypocenter. Then we calculated the response of a two-dimensional hill with the height 0.3 km and the width 2.4 km to (1) a plane SV wave with a nearly critical angle of incidence, (2) a horizontal line force, (3) a Haskell-type 2D dislocation source, and (4) a Bouchon-type 2D multiple crack source. The results show that the amplification due to the hill relative to the flat surface is more than 1.5 for all the source models. Since this amplification is nearly independent of the source type and spectrum, we conclude that the combined effect of the topographic irregularity and critically incident SV waves might be responsible for the concentration of damage observed during the Whittier Narrows earthquake.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent interest in the extraction of fine detail from field seismograms has stimulated the search for numerical modeling procedures which can produce synthetic seismograms for complex subsurface geometries and for arbitrary source-receiver separations. Among the various techniques available for this purpose, the replacement of the two-dimensional wave equation by a suitable finite-difference representation offers distinct advantages. This approach is simple and may be readily implemented. It automatically accounts for the proper relative amplitudes of the various arrivals and includes the contributions of converted waves, Rayleigh waves, diffractions from faulted zones, and head waves.Two computational schemes have been examined. For the so-called 'homogeneous formulation,' the standard boundary conditions between media of different elastic properties must be satisfied explicitly. In the case of the alternate 'heterogeneous formulation', these elastic properties may be specified at each grid point of a finite-difference mesh, and the boundary conditions are satisfied implicitly. The proper simulation of the source requires special treatment for both cases.Synthetic seismograms computed for several models of exploration interest serve to illustrate how the technique may help the interpreter. The examples also illustrate various implementational aspects of the finite-difference approach, which involve such phenomena as grid dispersion, artificial reflections from the edge of the model, and choice of spatial and temporal sampling increments.},

  Abstract                 = {This work focuses on the analysis of the multiple interactions between soil layers and civil-engineering structures in dense urban areas submitted to a seismic wave. To investigate such phenomena, called site-city interaction (SCI) herein, two simplified site-city configurations are considered: a homogeneous, periodically spaced city and a heterogeneous, nonperiodically spaced city, both on a constant- depth basin model. These 2D boundary-element method models are subjected to a vertically incident plane SH Ricker wavelet. A parametric study of the city parameters (density of buildings and their natural frequencies) and the thickness of the basin is carried out to characterize the SCI and to investigate its sensitivity to some governing parameters. The following parameters are analyzed: building vibrations, induced ground motion, ground-motion perturbations inside and outside the city, spatial coherency, and kinetic energy of the "urban wave field." A so-called site-city resonance is reached when the soil fundamental frequency and structure eigenfrequencies coincide; building vibrations and ground motion are then significantly decreased and the spatial coherency of the urban field is also strongly modified. Building density and city configuration play a crucial role in the energy distribution inside the city.},

  Abstract                 = {We performed 3D ground-motion simulations for 10 recent small to moderate earthquakes (Mw 4.1-5.4) in the San Francisco Bay area to evaluate two versions of the USGS 3D velocity model (Brocher, 2005; Jachens et al., 2006; Brocher, 2008). Comparisons were made in terms of modeling phase arrival timing, peak ground-motion amplitudes, and the seismic waveforms. In the simulations we assumed the source parameters reported in the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory (BSL) Moment Tensor Catalog. Broadband seismic data from the Berkeley Digital Seismic Network (BDSN), and strong motion data from the USGS and the California Geological Survey (CGS) strong motion arrays were used in the analysis. The comparison of peak ground velocity (PGV) for both models reveals that both 3D models predict the observed PGV well over four orders of magnitude, and P- and S-wave timing and pseudospectral acceleration (PSA) are well modeled by the 3D structure. While the revised model (model 8.3.0) significantly improved the timing of the first arrival, and the waveform fit is generally good, there remain discrepancies in estimated amplitudes and durations that require improvements to the structure. Nevertheless, from our low-frequency (0.5 Hz) analysis we found that the 3D model is suitable for the simulation of PGV to assess the strong shaking hazard of future large earthquakes, because earthquakes larger than M 6 have PGV carried by waves of 1 to several seconds period.},

  Abstract                 = {Large scale ground motion simulation in realistic basins can benefit greatly from the use of parallel supercomputing systems in order to obtain reliable and useful results within reasonable elapsed time due to its large problem size. We present a parallel octree-based multiresolution finite element methodology for the elastodynamic wave propagation problem and develop a framework for large scale wave propagation simulations. The framework is comprised of three parts; (1) a mesh generator (Euclid, Tu et al. 2002), (2) a parallel mesh partitioner (ParMETIS, Karypis et al. 2002), and (3) a parallel octree-based multiresolution finite element solver (QUAKE, Kim 2003). The octree-based multiresolution finite element method reduces memory use significantly and improves overall computational performance. The numerical methodology and the framework have been used to simulate the seismic response of the greater Los Angeles basin for a mainshock of the 1994 Northridge Earthquake, for frequencies of up to 1 Hz and domain size of 80 x 80 x 30 km3. Through simulations for several models, ranging in size from 400,000 to 300 million degrees of freedom on the 3000-processors HP-Compaq AlphaServer Cluster at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC), we achieve excellent performance and scalability.},

Usually the context is fieldwork far from home, in an area subjected to the natural but sometimes devastating effects of an earthquake. But in the present case we are in our own New York City area; that is, the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, in Palisades, N.Y.; and the context is inhuman actions against people and the fabric of our society. As the appalling events of September 11 unfolded, we found that we had recorded numerous seismic signals from two plane impacts and building collapses from the two World Trade Center (WTC) towers, often at times different than those being reported elsewhere. Collapses of the two WTC towers generated large seismic waves, observed in five states and up to 428 km away. The North Tower collapse was the largest seismic source and had local magnitude ML 2.3. From this we infer that ground shaking of the WTC towers was not a major contributor to the collapse or damage to surrounding buildings, but unfortunately we also conclude that from the distance at which our own detections were made (the nearest station is 34 km away at Palisades, N.Y.) it is not possible to infer (with detail sufficient to meet the demands of civil engineers in an emergency situation) just what the near-in ground motions must have been.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents activities of Nuclear Power Engineering Corporation (NUPEC) in the field of the study on soil structure interaction (SSI). NUPEC had performed three projects related to the SSI study. These are ``Model Tests on Dynamic Interaction Between Reactor Building and Soil'', ``Model Tests on Base-mat Uplift of Reactor Building'', and ``Model Test on Embedment Effect of Reactor Building''. Through the tests, the adequacy of the analytical methods applied to the current aseismic design was confirmed. Nevertheless NUPEC is recognizing that the SSI phenomena is still problematic and there are many unresolved problems such as handling of uncertainty in detailed soil structure, the nonlinear behavior of soil, and structure-structure interaction etc. The dynamic cross interaction (DCI) between adjacent structures is one of the biggest problems of this kind. NUPEC then had planned the project to investigate the DCI effect in 1993. The project has started as ``Model Tests on Dynamic Cross Interaction Effects of Adjacent Structures''. The project consists of field and laboratory tests and starts in 1994 and will be completed in early 2002. In this paper we describe firstly a brief review of the results of the past three test projects on SSI performed by NUPEC. Secondly, we describe an outline and a summary of the current status of the on-going project, ``Model Tests on Dynamic Cross Interaction Effects of Adjacent Structures''.},

Most notably the justificationist positions in the philosophy of science that Naylor and Finger appealed to have been largely discredited.

At present in the philosophy of science, there appears to be a convergence toward a nonalgorithmic but discursive and nonrelativistic view of the argumentation involved in warranting scientific theorizing. The present paper attempts to give a description of the various philosophical positions as well as to summarize their problems and the kinds of evidentiary arguments they would each allow in arriving at defensible simulation models. From the debate, we attempt to set out a perspective that frees the practioner to pursue a varied set of approaches to validation with a diminished burden of methodological anxiety. Reciprocally this perspective does not let the modeler off of the hook but rather converts the validation problem into an ethical problem in which the practitioner must responsibly and professionally argue for the warrant of the model.},

In the analysis both of strain-dependent material nonlinearity, and geometrical nonlinearity by base mat uplift, were considered. The `Lattice Model' for the soil-structure interaction model was employed. An earthquake record on soil surface at the site was used as control motion, and deconvoluted to the input motion of the analysis model at GL-52 m with 300 Gal of maximum acceleration. The following two analyses were considered: (A) time history nonlinear, (B) equivalent linear, and the advantage of time history nonlinear earthquake response analysis method is discussed.},

Teleseismic P-wave arrival times are obtained from three temporary passive experiments and Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) stations, producing good raypath coverage. The inversion is performed using a damped least-squares conjugate gradient method (LSQR). The inversion model element spacing is 20 km. Before the inversion, the effects of crustal velocity heterogeneities represented by the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) seismic velocity model version 2 are removed from the teleseismic travel times. The P-wave inversion produces a variance reduction of 43 percent. S-wave velocities are determined from laboratory Vp/Vs ratios. The most prominent features imaged in the results are high P-wave velocities (+3 percent) in the uppermost mantle beneath the northern Los Angeles basin, and the previously reported tabular high-velocity anomaly (+3 percent) to depths of 200 km beneath the Transverse Ranges, crosscutting the San Andreas fault. We incorporate the upper mantle seismic velocity heterogeneities into the SCEC Southern California reference seismic velocity model. The prior accounting for the crustal velocity heterogeneity demonstrates the utility of the top-down method of the SCEC seismic velocity model development.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a two-stage method to simulate the ground motions produced by an earthquake by using stochastic summation of small earthquakes. In this method, identical small earthquakes are multiplied by a scaling factor and summed together with time delays randomly distributed, during the two stages, over the source duration. The summation scheme is characterized by four fundamental parameters: the number of summed small earthquakes, the scaling factor, and both probability densities of time delays used in the first and second stages. By a proper choice of these parameters, this method generates a large number of synthetic time histories that, on average, agree exactly with the{omega} -2 model in the whole frequency band. The produced time histories are sufficiently realistic and different from each other to be associated with a multitude of rupture processes that could happen during an earthquake. However, because the extended target fault is approximated by a point source, this method does not take into account possible directivity effects and is not appropriate to simulate ground motions for near-source sites. We test this method on the Oaxaca earthquake (1999, Mw 7.5, Mexico) at regional distances and on the two mainshocks of the Umbria Marche crisis (1997, Mw 5.7 and Mw 6.0, Italy) at local distances. We found that the simulated ground motions fit the observed data well, both in time and in frequency domains. Within simulation context, only specification of seismic moment and stress drop is required for the target event. Because the magnitude and then the seismic moment are necessarily specified, the stress drop plays a major role in ground-motion simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate simulation of seismic ground motion for three-dimensionally complex topography and structures is one of the most important goals of strong motion seismology. The finite-element method (FEM) is well suited for this kind of simulation, since traction-free conditions are already included in the formulation, and the Courant condition is less strict than for the finite-difference method (FDM). However, the FEM usually requires both large memory and computation time. These limitations can be overcome by using a mesh consisting of voxels (rectangular prisms) with isotropy built into the explicit formulation of the dynamic matrix equation. Since operators in the voxel FEM are the combinations of ordinary FDM operators and additional terms, the method keeps accuracy of the same order as FDM and the terms relax the Courant condition. The voxel FEM requires a similar amount of memory and only takes 1.2~1.4 times longer computation time. The voxel mesh can be generated considerably faster than the popular tetrahedral mesh. Both ground motions and static displacements due to a point or line source can be calculated using the voxel FEM approach. Comparisons with the reflectivity method and theoretical solutions demonstrate the successful implementation of the method, which is then applied to more complex problems.},

For isotropic media, the spectral element method is known for its high degree of accuracy, its ability to handle complex model geometries, and its low computational cost. We show that the method can be extended to fully anisotropic media. The mass matrix obtained is diagonal by construction, which leads to a very efficient fully explicit solver. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by comparing it against a known analytical solution for a 2-D transversely isotropic test case, and by comparing its predictions against those based upon a finite difference method for a 2-D heterogeneous, anisotropic medium. We show its generality and its flexibility by modeling wave propagation in a 3-D transversely isotropic medium with a symmetry axis tilted relative to the axes of the grid.},

The numerical simulations account for 3D variations of seismic-wave speeds and density, topography and bathymetry, and attenuation. Simulations for the 9 September 2001 Mw 4.2 Hollywood earthquake and the 3 September 2002 Mw 4.2 Yorba Linda earthquake demonstrate that the combination of a detailed sedimentary basin model and an accurate numerical technique facilitates the simulation of ground motion at periods of 2 sec and longer inside the basin model and 6 sec and longer in the regional model.

The method combines the flexibility of a finite element method with the accuracy of a spectral method. One uses a weak formulation of the equations of motion, which are solved on a mesh of hexahedral elements that is adapted to the free surface and to the main internal discontinuities of the model. The wavefield on the elements is discretized using high-degree Lagrange interpolants, and integration over an element is accomplished based upon the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre integration rule. This combination of discretization and integration results in a diagonal mass matrix, which greatly simplifies the algorithm. We illustrate the great potential of the method by comparing it to a discrete wavenumber/reflectivity method for layer-cake models. Both body and surface waves are accurately represented, and the method can handle point force as well as moment tensor sources. For a model with very steep surface topography we successfully benchmark the method against an approximate boundary technique. For a homogeneous medium with strong attenuation we obtain excellent agreement with the analytical solution for a point force.},

The spectral element method introduced here is a high-order variational method for the spatial approximation of elastic-wave equations. The mass matrix is diagonal by construction in this method, which drastically reduces the computational cost and allows an efficient parallel implementation. Absorbing boundary conditions are introduced in variational form to simulate unbounded physical domains. The time discretization is based on an energy-momentum conserving scheme that can be put into a classical explicit-implicit predictor/multi-corrector format. Long-term energy conservation and stability properties are illustrated as well as the efficiency of the absorbing conditions. The associated Courant condition behaves as {Delta}tC < O (nel-1/ndN-2), with nel the number of elements, nd the spatial dimension, and N the polynomial order. In practice, a spatial sampling of approximately 5 points per wavelength is found to be very accurate when working with a polynomial degree of N = 8. The accuracy of the method is shown by comparing the spectral element solution to analytical solutions of the classical two-dimensional (2D) problems of Lamb and Garvin. The flexibility of the method is then illustrated by studying more realistic 2D models involving realistic geometries and complex free-boundary conditions. Very accurate modeling of Rayleigh-wave propagation, surface diffraction, and Rayleigh-to-body-wave mode conversion associated with the free-surface curvature are obtained at low computational cost. The method is shown to provide an efficient tool to study the diffraction of elastic waves by three-dimensional (3D) surface topographies and the associated local effects on strong ground motion. Complex amplification patterns, both in space and time, are shown to occur even for a gentle hill topography. Extension to a heterogeneous hill structure is considered. The efficient implementation on parallel distributed memory architectures will allow to perform real-time visualization and interactive physical investigations of 3D amplification phenomena for seismic risk assessment.},

Seismol. Soc. Am. 2003; 93(2): 817-824), is a two-step procedure that aims at reducing the domain that has to be modelled numerically by a change of governing variables. The seismic excitation is directly introduced into the computational domain and an artificial boundary is needed only to absorb the scattered energy of the system. The extended formulation of the DRM is presented and validated for linear and nonlinear analyses in a boundary value problem.},

We define TF misfit criteria for quantification and characterization of disagreement between two three-component signals. We distinguish two cases2014with and without having one signal as reference. We define locally and globally normalized TF criteria. The locally normalized misfits can be used if it is important to investigate relatively small parts of the signal (e.g. wave groups, pulses, transients, spikes, so-called seismic phases) no matter how large amplitudes of those parts are with respect to the maximum amplitude of the signal. They provide a detailed TF anatomy of the disagreement between two entire signals. The globally normalized misfits can be used for quantifying an overall level of disagreement. They allow accounting for both the envelope/phase difference at a TF point and the significance of the envelope at that point with respect to the maximum envelope of the signal. We also introduce the TF envelope and phase goodness-of-fit criteria based on the complete signal representation, and thus suitable for comparing arbitrary time signals in their entire TF complexity. The TF goodness-of-fit criteria quantify the level of agreement and are most suitable in the case of larger differences between the signals. We numerically demonstrate the capability and important features of the TF misfit and goodness-of-fit criteria in the methodologically important examples.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed and numerically tested quantitative misfit criteria for comparison of seismograms. The misfit criteria are based on the time-frequency representation of the seismograms obtained as the continuous wavelet transform with the analyzing Morlet wavelet. The misfit criteria include time-frequency envelope and phase misfits, time-dependent envelope and phase misfits, frequency-dependent envelope and phase misfits, and single-valued envelope and phase misfits. We tested properties of the misfit criteria using canonical signals. The canonical signals, taken as the reference signals, were specifically amplitude, phase shift, time shift, and frequency modified to demonstrate the ability of the misfit criteria to properly quantify the misfits and recognize the character and cause of the misfits between the reference and modified signals. In all cases the misfit criteria properly quantified and characterized the misfits. The misfit criteria were also calculated for four different numerical solutions for a single layer over half-space (the SCEC LOH.3 problem) and the reference FK solution. The misfit criteria provided useful insight into the misfits between individual numerical solutions and the reference solution. The standard RMS misfit matches the single-valued envelope misfit only in the case of a pure amplitude modification of the signal. In all other cases RMS considerably overestimates the misfits and does not characterize them.},

  Abstract                 = {During the 2002 Molise sequence, a shock was recorded in a building that suffered heavy damage (Mucciarelli et al., 2004). The availability of this data, along with other similar data, led to the organization of an international workshop for structural engineers aimed at the reproduction of the staged evolution of damage observed (A. Goretti and M. Mucciarelli, unpublished manuscript, 2007). The aim of this present work is to model the damaged building; the adjacent, less damaged building; and a large section of the subsoil. The model should provide some insight into two possible phenomena: (1) the soil-structure interaction (SSI), that is, the modification of the free-field seismic response induced by the presence of the buildings located on soft soil; and (2) the possible interaction between the two buildings. The study was performed using the 2D Chebyshev spectral element method (SPEM) for a 2D section. The model, with topography, includes the bedrock (limestone) with the overlaying clay layer, circa 30 m. The building is modeled by an equivalent shear-wave velocity, which is calculated from its identified mechanical properties. First, the model's ability to reproduce the motions recorded inside and outside the building was verified. Then, one or both of the buildings were removed to study their effect. The influence of the presence of buildings on the free-field motion is about 40% on spectral values, and it is felt up to a distance of about 250 m from the buildings. The results also suggest the presence of resonance between buildings.},

  Abstract                 = {I describe the properties of a fourth-order accurate space, second-order accurate time, two-dimensional P-SV finite-difference scheme based on the Madariaga-Virieux staggered-grid formulation. The numerical scheme is developed from the first-order system of hyperbolic elastic equations of motion and constitutive laws expressed in particle velocities and stresses. The Madariaga-Virieux staggered-grid scheme has the desirable quality that it can correctly model any variation in material properties, including both large and small Poisson's ratio materials, with minimal numerical dispersion and numerical anisotropy. Dispersion analysis indicates that the shortest wavelengths in the model need to be sampled at 5 gridpoints/wavelength. The scheme can be used to accurately simulate wave propagation in mixed acoustic-elastic media, making it ideal for modeling marine problems. Explicitly calculating both velocities and stresses makes it relatively simple to initiate a source at the free-surface or within a layer and to satisfy free-surface boundary conditions. Benchmark comparisons of finite-difference and analytical solutions to Lamb's problem are almost identical, as are comparisons of finite-difference and reflectivity solutions for elastic-elastic and acoustic-elastic layered models.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new method for calculating broadband time histories of ground motion based on a hybrid low-frequency/high-frequency approach with correlated source parameters. Using a finite-difference method we calculate low- frequency synthetics (1 Hz) in a 3D velocity structure. We also compute broadband synthetics in a 1D velocity model using a frequency-wavenumber method. The low frequencies from the 3D calculation are combined with the high frequencies from the 1D calculation by using matched filtering at a crossover frequency of 1 Hz. The source description, common to both the 1D and 3D synthetics, is based on correlated random distributions for the slip amplitude, rupture velocity, and rise time on the fault. This source description allows for the specification of source parameters independent of any a priori inversion results. In our broadband modeling we include correlation between slip amplitude, rupture velocity, and rise time, as suggested by dynamic fault modeling. The method of using correlated random source parameters is flexible and can be easily modified to adjust to our changing understanding of earthquake ruptures. A realistic attenuation model is common to both the 3D and 1D calculations that form the low- and high-frequency components of the broadband synthetics. The value of Q is a function of the local shear-wave velocity. To produce more accurate high-frequency amplitudes and durations, the 1D synthetics are corrected with a randomized, frequency-dependent radiation pattern. The 1D synthetics are further corrected for local site and nonlinear soil effects by using a 1D nonlinear propagation code and generic velocity structure appropriate for the site's National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) site classification. The entire procedure is validated by comparison with the 1994 Northridge, California, strong ground motion data set. The bias and error found here for response spectral acceleration are similar to the best results that have been published by others for the Northridge rupture.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to satisfactorily reproduce the Soil-Structure Interaction (SSI) effects under earthquake loading, it is often necessary to model a large domain of the soil surrounding the structure of interest. High spatial/temporal resolution is another challenge in analyzing these models. A new parallel nonlinear finite element program, ParCYCLIC, is employed to study such high fidelity large-scale SSI models. ParCYCLIC incorporates a constitutive model that has been calibrated by physical tests to represent the salient characteristics of sand liquefaction and associated accumulation of shear deformations. The numerical implementation is designed for distributed-memory parallel computer systems, and allows for performing explicit as well as implicit time integration. In this paper, a single pile embedded in mildly inclined, liquefiable soil deposit is analyzed under dynamic base shaking conditions. Aspects of model response, including pore pressure generation/dissipation, soil lateral deformation during liquefaction, and pile displacement and bending moment, are presented and discussed.},

It is also shown that forced vibration tests can be used to obtain estimates of the foundation impedance functions.

In the case of the Millikan Library it is found that during forced vibration tests the rigid-body motion associated with translation and rocking of the base accounts for more than 30 per cent of the total response on the roof and that the deformation of the superstructure at the fundamental frequencies of the system is almost entirely due to the inertial forces generated by translation and rocking of the base.},

The model consists of detailed, rule-based representations of the major southern California basins (Los Angeles basin, Ventura basin, San Gabriel Valley, San Fernando Valley, Chino basin, San Bernardino Valley, and the Salton Trough), embedded in a 3D crust over a variable depth Moho. Outside of the basins, the model crust is based on regional tomographic results. The model Moho is represented by a surface with the depths determined by the receiver function technique. Shallow basin sediment velocities are constrained by geotechnical data. The model is implemented in a computer code that generates any specified 3D mesh of seismic velocity and density values. This parameterization is convenient to store, transfer, and update as new information and verification results become available.},

The aim of this study is to propose a 3D model of this sedimentary structure that can later be used to model the seismic records currently being obtained by the permanent accelerograph network operating in the area. This model builds on previous efforts and incorporates new data. The geometry and dynamic properties of the soil layers were inverted using data from microtremor array measurements, seismic refraction profiles, boreholes, and geotechnical investigations. Phase-velocity dispersion curves of Rayleigh waves were determined at 27 sites in the basin using the spatial autocorrelation method (SPAC) introduced by Aki. S-wave velocity profiles were inverted from these dispersion curves and the whole valley structure was interpolated using our new results and all previously available data. The proposed 3D model describes the geometry and shear-wave velocities of the Mygdonian and pre-Mygdonian sedimentary systems, and the top bedrock surface. Our results indicate that this 3D model correctly reflects the geometry and dynamic properties of the sedimentary layers. The case of Euroseistest, where the subsoil structure is the result of bringing together many disparate data, could be used as an example for similar alluvial basins throughout the world, where usually only scarce data is available.},

  Abstract                 = {Theoretical comparisons of linear and nonlinear seismic responses of two-dimensional (2D) alluvial basins show that in general the character of the seismic wave propagation is similar in both cases, but important differences exist regarding both the time history and the response spectra. The nonlinear model, based on yielding elements arranged into a 2D finite-difference mesh, tends to distribute the total seismic energy over longer time durations, resulting in lower peak accelerations and lower response spectra than those produced by the linear model. On the other hand, the Fourier spectra in each comparison are similar; particularly the peak amplitudes occur at about the same frequencies in both cases. However, resonant peaks, obtained with both models for weak input amplitudes, do not appear when the input amplitude is increased 10-fold in the nonlinear case, due to greater damping determined by its assumed stress-strain relationship, which restricts the buildup of resonances. The examples presented in this study correspond to a trapezoidal sedimentary basin embedded in an elastic half-space. The $P$- and $S$-wave velocities of the sediments are chosen to be constant in one case, and linearly varying with depth in the other. The input motion is obtained from the bedrock at the Castaic Old Ridge Route Station, during the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, scaled to provide a ``weak'' motion, with peak acceleration 0.04 g, and a ``strong motion'' with peak acceleration 0.4 g. In the linear case, suitable values of Q are chosen to yield the same average damping as that by the nonlinear case, for both inputs.},

  Abstract                 = {In dense urban areas, buildings are arranged in clusters (i.e., the city block). However, these buildings are designed with the assumption that they are isolated from one another, there by ignoring the complex effects of interactions between buildings during earthquakes. The paucity of design tools in this subject area is the result of (1) an incomplete understanding of soil-foundation-structureinteraction (SFSI); and (2) a lack of well-documented case histories that could be used to develop understanding of the interaction of closely-spaced buildings and validate numerical models. This research project aims to remedy these shortcomings by performing seven well-documented centrifuge tests of physical models of building clusters and developing design guidance on the basis of centrifuge data and the associate numerical studies.}

  Abstract                 = {We are generating physically plausible near-field synthetic ground motions for the great 1964 Prince William Sound, Alaska, earthquake compatible with available seismological data, tectonic information, and eyewitness accounts. The first objective of this study is the simulation of the low-frequency (i.e., f<0.03 Hz) strong ground motions on selected locations and on a dense grid of observation points extending over the shallow dipping causative fault of the 1964 Alaska earthquake. In order to accomplish this task, we are utilizing the slip model proposed by Johnson et al. (1996) based on a joint inversion of tsunami waveforms and geodetic data. The calculations are carried out using the discrete wavenumber representation method (Bouchon and Aki, 1977; Bouchon, 1979) and the generalized transmission and reflection coefficient technique (Luco and Apsel, 1983). The second objective of this study is the reconstruction of the strong ground motion time histories and response spectra that the city of Anchorage experienced during the 1964 Alaska earthquake. The low-frequency (i.e., f<0.03 Hz) ground motions are generated using the methodology described previously. The intermediate-frequency (i.e., 0.03<f<0.50 Hz) ground motions are simulated by convolving Green's functions generated by the discrete wavenumber representation method with far-field radiation pulses of circular cracks (Sato and Hirasawa, 1973; Dong and Papageorgiou, 2002a). The high-frequency (i.e., 0.5<f<8.0 Hz) ground motions are simulated using the stochastic modeling approach. The three independently derived ground-motion components are then properly combined to generate synthetic broadband ground-motion time histories and response spectra for the city of Anchorage due to the 1964 Prince William Sound earthquake. The third objective of this study is the validation of the synthetic strong ground motions for the 1964 Alaska earthquake against observed tectonic deformation, ground-motion estimates inferred from descriptions of structural damage, and eyewitness accounts. In summary, the analysis presented in this study contributes to a better understanding of the seismological aspects of the 1964 Alaska earthquake and provides synthetic time histories and response spectra for engineering applications compatible with all available information (i.e., seismological, tectonic, and eyewitness accounts). It should be noted however that the generated strong ground motions are not necessarily unique, nor do they reflect the entire uncertainty that characterizes the problem under investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {A 14-storey reinforced concrete building and the underlying soil were instrumented with strong motion accelerographs to study the amplification of seismic waves, the soil-structure interaction and the structural response to earthquakes of buildings founded on soft soil, such as the lake-bed area of Mexico City. A detailed investigation of the geotechnical properties of the site and of the structural characteristics of the building was performed, including the measurement of the shear wave velocity in the different soil layers. The instrumentation consists of 14 strong motion accelerographs, two of them underground, one in free-field and 11 in the building. In the first three years of operation of the instrumentation, six sets of records were obtained from weak and moderate earthquakes. The main features of the seismic response of the building and its interaction with the soil were derived from the analysis of seismic recordings. Ambient vibration tests were also performed to determine basic dynamic properties. The accuracy of different models of the structure and of its interaction with the soil are discussed. In general terms, the building proved to be rather flexible in both horizontal directions, and the deformations due to soil-structure interaction were not very significant. Vibration periods of the building were found to increase significantly with the intensity of the ground shaking, indicating the non-linear behaviour of the structure, even under small levels of excitation.},

  Abstract                 = {This study discusses the effectiveness of the hybrid Green's function method (HGF) in simulating near-field strong ground motions. The HGF method starts with calculating the synthetic Green's function, which is a combination of deterministically calculated, low-frequency motion and stochastically simulated, high- frequency motion. Summation of Green's functions using the numerical framework of the empirical Green's function method gives the large earthquake synthetics. We simulated the M 6.0 2004 Parkfield earthquake producing near-fault ground motion that favorably compares with the empirical data. We carried out simulations for the frequency range 0.1-25 Hz at eight rock and four soil site stations. Frequency- dependent site-amplification values are calculated using empirical data and considered for the soil site simulations. The comparisons of simulated motion in time and frequency domain proved the efficiency of the HGF method in such broadband simulations.},

The purpose of the deployment was to investigate factors relevant to seismic zonation in urban areas, such as site amplification, sedimentary basin effects, and the variability of ground motion over short baselines. We placed seismographs at 47 sites (not all concurrently) and recorded about 290 earthquakes with magnitudes up to 5.1 at five stations or more. We deployed widely spaced stations for profiles across the San Fernando Valley, as well as five dense arrays (apertures of 200 to 500 m) in areas of high damage, such as the collapsed Interstate 10 overpass, Sherman Oaks, and the collapsed parking garage at CalState Northridge. Aftershock data analysis indicates a correlation of site amplification with mainshock damage. We found several cases where the site amplification depended on the azimuth of the aftershock, possibly indicating focusing from basin structures. For the parking garage array, we found large ground-motion variabilities (a factor of 2) over 200-m distances for sites on the same mapped soil unit. Array analysis of the aftershock seismograms demonstrates that sizable arrivals after the direct S waves consist of surface waves traveling from the same azimuth as that of the epicenter. These surface waves increase the duration of motions and can have frequencies as high as about 4 Hz. For the events studied here, we do not observe large arrivals reflected from the southern edge of the San Fernando Valley.},

The base shear forces were measured, the foundation compliance of the models being changed through a very wide range. The properties specified for the building models are shown to be similar to the properties found in real buildings. The experimental results imply that the maximum base shear forces in typical buildings of five stories and higher during strong-motion earthquakes will be essentially unaffected by any degree of foundation compliance that can be expected in normal building practice. The fundamental period of typical buildings will be increased by about 10 per cent if the foundation compliance is the maximum that can be expected in standard building practice.},

  Abstract                 = {A nonconvolutional, split-field, perfectly matched layer, referred to as the multiaxial perfectly matched layer (M-PML), is proposed and implemented. The new formulation is obtained by generalizing the classical perfectly matched layer (PML; as originally proposed by Berenger, [1994]) to a medium in which damping profiles are specified in more than one direction. Under the hypothesis of small damping and using an eigenvalue sensitivity analysis based on first derivatives, we propose a method to study the stability of the M-PML. With this method we demonstrate that the stability of the M-PML is related to the ratios of the specified damping profiles. Recognition of this fact leads to a general procedure for constructing robust, stable M-PML models for anisotropic media. It is also demonstrated that for any anisotropic medium the classical PML exhibits instabilities related to an eigenvalue with zero real part of multiplicity higher than one. Furthermore, we show that exponential growth due to eigenvalues with positive real part can be present in the classical PML for some orthotropic media. The effectiveness of the proposed M-PML and its advantages relative to the classical PML are demonstrated by constructing stable terminations for the aforementioned anisotropic media. The method of stability analysis is developed and demonstrated for two-dimensional elastodynamics problems, but its extension to three-dimensional configurations is straightforward.},

The strong motion generation areas are defined as extended areas with relatively large slip velocities within a total rupture area. Four M 6 class (the 1997 Kagoshima on March and May, 1997 Yamaguchi, and 1998 Iwate) and several moderate-size earthquakes in Japan were analyzed. We examine the relationship between the strong motion generation area and the area of asperities, which is characterized based on heterogeneous slip distributions estimated from low-frequency (<1 Hz) waveform inversions (Somerville et al., 1999). We performed waveform fitting in acceleration, velocity, and displacement, then obtained the strong motion generation area occupying about a quarter of the total rupture area. The size and position of the strong motion generation area coincide with those of characterized asperities. We find self-similar scaling of seismic moment to both the size of the strong motion generation area and the rise time for a magnitude range of analyzed earthquakes. Based on our results, we propose a characterized source model for the broadband ground-motion simulation, which consists of strong motion generation areas with large slip velocities and a background slip area with a small slip velocity. Waveform modeling of the characterized source model suggests that the strong motion generation areas play important roles in simulating broadband ground motions and have the potential to be an about 10-MPa stress-release area on the fault.},

The technique allows better adjusted modelling of a medium and, in numerical examples presented, yields more efficient computations as compared to those with regular grids.

  Abstract                 = {Numerical modeling of seismic wave propagation and earthquake motion is an irreplaceable tool in investigation of the Earth's structure, processes in the Earth, and particularly earthquake phenomena. Among various numerical methods, the finite-difference method is the dominant method in the modeling of earthquake motion. Moreover, it is becoming more important in the seismic exploration and structural modeling. At the same time we are convinced that the best time of the finite-difference method in seismology is in the future. This monograph provides tutorial and detailed introduction to the application of the finitedifference (FD), finite-element (FE), and hybrid FD-FE methods to the modeling of seismic wave propagation and earthquake motion. The text does not cover all topics and aspects of the methods. We focus on those to which we have contributed. We present alternative formulations of equation of motion for a smooth elastic continuum. We then develop alternative formulations for a canonical problem with a welded material interface and free surface. We continue with a model of an earthquake source. We complete the general theoretical introduction by a chapter on the constitutive laws for elastic and viscoelastic media, and brief review of strong formulations of the equation of motion. What follows is a block of chapters on the finite-difference and finite-element methods. We develop FD targets for the free surface and welded material interface. We then present various FD schemes for a smooth continuum, free surface, and welded interface. We focus on the staggered-grid and mainly optimally-accurate FD schemes. We also present alternative formulations of the FE method. We include the FD and FE implementations of the traction-at-split-nodes method for simulation of dynamic rupture propagation. The FD modeling is applied to the model of the deep sedimentary Grenoble basin, France. The FD and FE methods are combined in the hybrid FD-FE method. The hybrid method is then applied to two earthquake scenarios for the Grenoble basin. Except chapters 1, 3, 5, and 12, all chapters include new, previously unpublished material and results.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyze the problem of a heterogeneous formulation of the equation of motion and propose a new 3D fourth-order staggered-grid finite-difference (FD) scheme for modeling seismic motion and seismic-wave propagation. We first consider a 1D problem for a welded planar interface of two half-spaces. A simple physical model of the contact of two media and mathematical considerations are shown to give an averaged medium representing the contact of two media. An exact heterogeneous formulation of the equation of motion is a basis for constructing the corresponding heterogeneous FD scheme. In a much more complicated 3D problem we analyze a planar-interface contact of two isotropic media (both with interface parallel to a coordinate plane and interface in general position in the Cartesian coordinate system) and a nonplanar-interface contact of two isotropic media. Because in the latter case 21 elastic coefficients at each point are necessary to describe the averaged medium, we consider simplified boundary conditions for which the averaged medium can be described by only two elastic coefficients. Based on the simplified approach we construct the explicit heterogeneous 3D fourth-order displacement-stress FD scheme on a staggered grid with the volume harmonic averaging of the shear modulus in grid positions of the stress-tensor components, volume harmonic averaging of the bulk modulus in grid positions of the normal stress-tensor components, and volume arithmetic averaging of density in grid positions of the displacement components. Our displacement-stress FD scheme can be easily modified into the velocity-stress or displacement-velocity-stress FD schemes. The scheme allows for an arbitrary position of the material discontinuity in the spatial grid. Numerical tests for 12 configurations in four types of models show that our scheme is more accurate than the staggered-grid schemes used so far. Numerical examples also show that differences in thickness of a soft surface or interior layer smaller than one grid spacing can cause considerable changes in seismic motion. The results thus underline the importance of having a FD scheme with sufficient sensitivity to heterogeneity of the medium.},

  Abstract                 = {A comparative discussion of constitutive rate equations generated by using the hypoelasticity and plasticity theories is presented. If is shown that these two approaches are equivalent for the loading process but differ essentially in defining the unloading (or reverse loading) paths. The multisurface plasticity formulation proves to be more convenient in incorporating memory rules of particular loading events, whereas loading-unloading criteria used in hypoelasticity may result in an unrealistic prediction of material response for some loading paths, and in particular, for cyclic loading. The violation of the continuity condition between loading-unloading domains in proposed constitutive relations3,4 limits their applicability to some particular classes of loading paths.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper computer modelling is used to test simple approximations for simulating strong ground motions for moderate and large earthquakes in the Mexicali-Imperial Valley region. Initially, we represent an earthquake rupture process as a series of many independent small earthquakes distributed in a somewhat random manner in both space and time along the rupture surface. By summing real seismograms for small earthquakes (used as empirical Green's functions), strong ground motions at specific sites near a fault are calculated. Alternatively, theoretical Green's functions that include frequencies up to 20 Hz are used in essentially similar simulations. The model uses random numbers to emulate some of the non-deterministic irregularities associated with real earthquakes, due either to complexities in the rupture process itself and/or strong variations in the material properties of the medium. Simulations of the 1980 June 9 Victoria, Baja California earthquake (ML = 6.1) approximately agree with the duration of shaking, the maximum ground acceleration, and the frequency content of strong ground motion records obtained at distances of up to 35 km for this moderate earthquake. In the initial stages of modelling we do not introduce any scaling of spectral shape with magnitude, in order to see at what stage the data require it. Surprisingly, such scaling is not critical in going from M = 4-5 events to the M = 6.1 Victoria earthquake. However, it is clearly required by the El Centro accelerogram for the Imperial Valley 1940 earthquake, which had a much higher moment (Ms ~ 7). We derive the spectral modification function for this event. The resulting model for this magnitude ~ 7 earthquake is then used to predict the ground motions at short distances from the fault. Predicted peak horizontal accelerations for the M ~ 7 event are about 25-50 per cent higher than those observed for the M = 6.1 Victoria event.},

  Abstract                 = {This study examines the response of soil profiles with nonlinear properties to several hundred synthetic seismograms, generated to represent rock ground motions from magnitude 6.4 and 7.0 scenario earthquakes. Two shear-wave velocity models (developed to represent Class CD and D sites with water table at 3 m) are tested. The computed ratios of peak ground acceleration (PGA) between the surface of the soil profile and the bedrock decreases with increasing PGA values. The transition from amplification to deamplification occurs at about 0.2-0.3 g. The spectral acceleration (SA) ratios, defined as the ratios of SA between the surface of the soil profile and the input, vary with the natural period of the oscillators. At short periods less than 0.3 sec, the behavior of the SA ratios is similar to the PGA ratios: amplification for lower input SA and deamplification for higher input SA level. At longer periods, the influence of the input SA level on SA ratio decreases, and deamplification is seldom observed. We define the mean trends of these calculations as rock motion modification curves (RMM curves). The use of these curves is as follows: a ground-motion relation on rock is multiplied by the RMM curve for that ground motion to obtain the expected ground-motion relation at the soil surface. This procedure is applied to six sets of empirical ground-motion relations. A majority of the empirical ground-motion relations are consistent with the RMM curves. In the best case, the comparisons indicate that the empirical soil site PGA and SA ground-motion relations are very close to the predicted curves at all epicentral distances. For both PGA and SA, the differences between the empirical and predicted curves are within one standard deviation of the empirical curves. It is quite encouraging that this physical model for soil behavior predicts the average characteristics of the surface motion, given the highly scattered nature of the data set.},

  Abstract                 = {Over 700 accelerograms recorded from 12 earthquakes in northeast Taiwan have been analyzed for investigating the behavior of vertical and horizontal peak and spectral ground motion in the near-source region. Peak horizontal and vertical ground acceleration (PGA), velocity (PGV), and displacement (PGD) in the range of engineering interest have been subjected to a two-step nonlinear regression procedure in terms of magnitude and hypocentral distance. In comparison with a number of other studies of global PGA observations, our predictions show lower far-field attenuation, lower near-source amplitudes, higher magnitude saturation for the vertical component, lower magnitude saturation for the horizontal component, and higher magnitude scaling. The 2 / 3 ratio of vertical to horizontal ground motion, commonly used in engineering applications, may be unconservative in the very near-field for high-frequency ground motion. It falls below 1 / 2 at distances greater than 50 km. The same ratio for PGV and PGD tends to increase with distance, the latter at a faster rate. For SMART-1 data the major source of uncertainty appears to be inter-event rather than intra-event randomness. The predominance of the inter-event uncertainty in ground motions near the source is expected to be a characteristic of all dense arrays.},

  Abstract                 = {Developers of computer codes, analysts who use the codes, and decision makers who rely on the results of the analyses face a critical question: How should confidence in modeling and simulation be critically assessed? Verification and validation (V\&V) of computational simulations are the primary methods for building and quantifying this confidence. Briefly, verification is the assessment of the accuracy of the solution to a computational model. Validation is the assessment of the accuracy of a computational simulation by comparison with experimental data. In verification, the relationship of the simulation to the real world is not an issue. In validation, the relationship between computation and the real world, ie, experimental data, is the issue. This paper presents our viewpoint of the state of the art in V\&V in computational physics. (In this paper we refer to all fields of computational engineering and physics, eg, computational fluid dynamics, computational solid mechanics, structural dynamics, shock wave physics, computational chemistry, etc, as computational physics.) We describe our view of the framework in which predictive capability relies on V\&V, as well as other factors that affect predictive capability. Our opinions about the research needs and management issues in V\&V are very practical: What methods and techniques need to be developed and what changes in the views of management need to occur to increase the usefulness, reliability, and impact of computational physics for decision making about engineering systems? We review the state of the art in V\&V over a wide range of topics, for example, prioritization of V\&V activities using the Phenomena Identification and Ranking Table (PIRT), code verification, software quality assurance (SQA), numerical error estimation, hierarchical experiments for validation, characteristics of validation experiments, the need to perform nondeterministic computational simulations in comparisons with experimental data, and validation metrics. We then provide an extensive discussion of V\&V research and implementation issues that we believe must be addressed for V\&V to be more effective in improving confidence in computational predictive capability. Some of the research topics addressed are development of improved procedures for the use of the PIRT for prioritizing V\&V activities, the method of manufactured solutions for code verification, development and use of hierarchical validation diagrams, and the construction and use of validation metrics incorporating statistical measures. Some of the implementation topics addressed are the needed management initiatives to better align and team computationalists and experimentalists in conducting validation activities, the perspective of commercial software companies, the key role of analysts and decision makers as code customers, obstacles to the improved effectiveness of V\&V, effects of cost and schedule constraints on practical applications in industrial settings, and the role of engineering standards committees in documenting best practices for V\&V.

  Abstract                 = {We have used a 3D finite-difference method to simulate ground motion from elastodynamic propagating ruptures with constant slip on faults in the metropolitan area of Los Angeles, California. Simulations are carried out for hypothetical M 6.75 earthquakes on the Palos Verdes and Elysian Park faults and, for comparison, an approximation to the 17 January 1994 M 6.7 Northridge earthquake. The dominant subsurface features of this area are the deep sedimentary Los Angeles basin and the smaller and shallower San Fernando basin. Simulated ground motions are restricted to the frequency range 0.0 to 0.4 Hz. Ground-motion time histories show that, in general, sites associated with the largest particle velocities and cumulative kinetic energies are located (1) in the epicentral area, (2) above the deepest parts of the basins, and (3) near the steepest edges of the Los Angeles basin. We find maximum particle velocities for the Palos Verdes, Elysian Park, and Northridge simulations of 0.44, 0.67, and 0.58 m/sec, respectively. In each case, both the directivity of the rupture and the lower impedance of the basins significantly amplify the ground motion. Although the gross radiation pattern from these ruptures is observable, the 3D basin structure distorts the wave field and becomes a source for edge-generated waves. Signal durations at some basin sites last beyond 90 sec due to Love waves and refracted S waves that propagate into the sediments from the basin edges. Compared with the Palos Verdes event, the durations are generally smaller for the Elysian Park earthquake due to a smaller amount of Love waves generated at the basin edges. A simple approximation to the Northridge earthquake reproduces the overall spatial pattern of the long-period particle velocities, successfully predicts the timing of late-arriving waves, and matches the peak velocities with discrepancies generally less than a factor of 2. However, for localized areas immediately north and south of the Santa Monica Mountains, the computed ground motion underpredicts the observed horizontal peak velocities but matches the vertical ones. The pattern of simulated total cumulative kinetic energies is similar to that for the damage intensities observed near the epicenter of the Northridge event. While the Northridge earthquake caused damage in the Los Angeles area, the 3D simulations show that earthquakes with the same magnitude on the Palos Verdes or Elysian Park faults produce more severe ground shaking in the Los Angeles basin.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous numerical simulations (TeraShake1) of large (Mw 7.7) southern San Andreas fault earthquakes predicted localized areas of strong amplification in the Los Angeles area associated with directivity and wave-guide effects from northwestward-propagating rupture scenarios. The TeraShake1 source was derived from inversions of the 2002 Mw 7.9 Denali, Alaska, earthquake. That source was relatively smooth in its slip distribution and rupture characteristics, owing both to resolution limits of the inversions and simplifications imposed by the kinematic parameterization. New simulations (TeraShake2), with a more complex source derived from spontaneous rupture modeling with small-scale stress-drop heterogeneity, predict a similar spatial pattern of peak ground velocity (PGV), but with the PGV extremes decreased by factors of 2-3 relative to TeraShake1. The TeraShake2 source excites a less coherent wave field, with reduced along-strike directivity accompanied by streaks of elevated ground motion extending away from the fault trace. The source complexity entails abrupt changes in the direction and speed of rupture correlated to changes in slip-velocity amplitude and waveform, features that might prove challenging to capture in a purely kinematic parameterization. Despite the reduced PGV extremes, northwest-rupturing TeraShake2 simulations still predict entrainment by basin structure of a strong directivity pulse, with PGVs in Los Angeles and San Gabriel basins that are much higher than predicted by empirical methods. Significant areas of those basins have predicted PGV above the 2 percent probability of exceedance (POE) level relative to current attenuation relationships (even when the latter includes a site term to account for local sediment depth), and wave-guide focusing produces localized areas with PGV at roughly 0.1--0.2 percent POE (about a factor of 4.5 above the median). In contrast, at rock sites in the 0-100-km distance range, the median TeraShake2 PGVs are in very close agreement with the median empirical prediction, and extremes nowhere reach the 2 percent POE level. The rock-site agreement lends credibility to some of our source-modeling assumptions, including overall stress-drop level and the manner in which we assigned dynamic parameters to represent the mechanical weakness of near-surface material. Future efforts should focus on validating and refining these findings, assessing their probabilities of occurrence relative to alternative rupture scenarios for the southern San Andreas fault, and incorporating them into seismic hazard estimation for southern California.},

  Abstract                 = {We have used a 3D finite-difference method to model 0.2 to 1.2 Hz elastodynamic site amplification in the Salt Lake Valley, Utah. The valley is underlain by a sedimentary basin, which in our model has dimensions of 48 by 25 by 1.3 km. Simulations are carried out for a P wave propagating vertically from below and for P waves propagating horizontally to the north, south, east, and west in a two-layer model consisting of semi-consolidated sediments surrounded by bedrock. Results show that in general, sites with the largest particle velocities, cumulative kinetic energies, duration times of motion, and spectral magnitudes overlie the deepest parts of the basin. The maximum values of these parameters are generally found above steeply dipping parts of the basin walls. The largest vector particle velocities are associated with P or SV waves that come from within 10{degrees} of the source azimuth. Low-energy S and surface waves follow the strongest arrivals. The largest peak particle velocities, cumulative kinetic energies, signal durations, and spectral magnitudes in the simulations are, respectively, 2.9, 15.9, 40.0, and 3.5 times greater than the values at a rock site measured on the component parallel to the propagation direction of the incident P wave. Scattering and/or mode conversions at the basin boundaries contribute significantly to the signal duration times. As a check on the validity of our simulations, we compared our 3D synthetic seismograms for the vertically incident plane P wave to seismograms of nearly vertically incident teleseismic P waves recorded at an alluvium site in the valley and at a nearby rock site. The 3D synthetics for the alluvium site overestimate the relatively small amplification of the initial P wave and underestimate the large amplification of the coda. Using 2D simulations, we find that most of the discrepancies between the 3D synthetic and observed records can be explained by an apparently incorrect total sediment thickness, omission from the model of the near-surface low-velocity unconsolidated sediments and of attenuation, and the inexact modeling of the incidence angle of the teleseism. The records from a 2D simulation in which these deficiencies are remedied (with Q = 65), and which also includes topography and a near-surface velocity gradient in the bedrock, provide a better match to the teleseismic data than the records from the simple two-layer 3D simulation. Our results suggest that for steeply incident P waves, the impedance decrease and resonance effects associated with the deeper basin structure control the amplification of the initial P-wave arrival, whereas reverberations in the near-surface unconsolidated sediments generate the large-amplitude coda. These reverberations are caused mainly by P-to-S converted waves, and their strength is therefore highly sensitive to the incidence angle of the source.},

The unified potential leads to both intrinsic (with initial slope indicators to control elastic behavior) and extrinsic cohesive zone models. Path dependence of work-of-separation is investigated with respect to proportional and non-proportional paths--this investigation demonstrates consistency of the cohesive constitutive model. The potential-based model is verified by simulating a mixed-mode bending test. The actual potential is named PPR (Park-Paulino-Roesler), after the first initials of the authors' last names}

  Abstract                 = {To study the effects of nonlinearity in the seismic response of soils, a numerical simulation of the propagation of vertically incident seismic waves in horizontal soil layers were performed. Shear noiselike and monochromatic seismic waves of various intensities were used as input signals. The behavior of soils was described by a nonlinear hysteretic model. To extract and study nonlinear components in the ground response, the nonlinear system identification method and analysis of higher-order spectra of oscillations on the surface were applied. Even for weak input signals, the response of the simulated soils contained a noticeable nonlinear component. An increase in the intensity of input signals led to increasing distortions of propagating signals, due to the generation and growth of combination-frequency harmonics. The results show that odd types of nonlinearity are most typical for soils, such as cubic and fifth-order nonlinearities, causing generation of the third and fifth higher harmonics of main frequencies of input signals. Nonlinearities of even types, such as quadratic, fourth-order, and sixth-order, concerned with asymmetry, or skewness, of oscillations (i.e., quasi-static deformations of the surface) are usually weak, except some special cases, in which a stress-strain relationship of a soil can be represented by functions with noticeable even components. A weak nonlinearity results in an increase in high-frequency components, due to the generation of higher harmonics. In cases of strong nonlinearity, in which a decrease in amplification and in shear moduli become noticeable, changes in spectra of propagating signals achieve their maximum. As a result, input signals with arbitrary spectra are transformed into output signals with spectra of the type of E(f) [~] fk, where k depends on the properties of the medium.},

In this study, records of the mainshock of the Tottori earthquake are analyzed, and stresses and strains, induced by the strong motion in the upper 100 or 200 m of soil, are reconstructed at sites located within 80 km from the fault plane. For reconstructing stresses and strains, the method is applied, which we developed and used previously for studying the response of soils during the 1995 Kobe earthquake. Nonlinear time- dependent stress-strain relations in the soil layers are estimated based on vertical- array records. A good agreement between the observed and simulated accelerograms of the Tottori earthquake testifies to the validity of the obtained vertical distributions of stresses and strains in the soil layers. We also evaluated variations of the shear moduli of the soil layers, caused by the strong motion, at stations located at different distances from the fault plane. Changes in the rheological properties of the upper soil layers were found at the stations closest to the fault-plane. A similarity in stress- strain relations, describing the behavior of similar soils during the 1995 Kobe earthquake and the 2000 Tottori earthquake, was obtained, indicating the possibility of precasting soil behavior in future earthquakes at sites where profiling data are available.},

The accuracy of the proposed technique has been tested through comparisons with analytical solutions, conventional 3D staggered-grid FD with uniform grid spacing, and reflectivity methods for a variety of velocity models. Numerical tests with nonuniform grids suggest that the method allows sufficiently accurate modeling when the grid sampling rate is at least 6 grid points per shortest shear wavelength. The applicability for a finite fault with non-uniform distribution of point sources is also confirmed. The use of nonuniform spacing improves the efficiency of the FD methods when applied to large-scale structures by partially avoiding the spatial oversampling introduced by the uniform spacing in zones with high velocity. The significant reduction in computer memory that can be obtained by the new technique improves the efficiency of the 3D-FD method at handling shorter wavelengths, larger areas, or more realistic 3D velocity structures.},

The model is based on products of the Seismic Hazard Investigation in Puget Sound (SHIPS) and geophysical information from other studies of the region. The adequacy of the velocity model was evaluated based on analyses of goodness of fit between recorded and simulated ground-motion velocity from the M 6.8 Nisqually earthquake. The earthquake was located about 60 km south of Seattle with a hypocentral depth of 59 km. The analyses were performed in the frequency range of 0.02-0.5 Hz, using data from 40 stations. Although our model covers a wide area of the Puget Sound region, its quality is assessed in the Seattle region in which the distribution of stations that recorded the Nisqually earthquake was denser. Our 3D finite-difference ground-motion modeling suggests that the propagation of long-period waves (periods longer than 3 sec) in the Seattle basin is mostly affected by the deep basin structure. The tomographic velocity model of Parsons et al. (2001), combined with the model of depth to the basement of the Seattle basin of Blakely et al. (1999), was essential in preparing and constraining geometrical features of the proposed velocity model.},

In this article we analyze its effectiveness at simulating near-fault ground motions by comparisons with the empirical source time function method, empirical ground-motion-attenuation relations, and recorded near-fault ground motion. We present a simple model for introducing the effect of the radiation pattern to the stochastic Green's functions in the intermediate frequency range (1-3 Hz). The numerical test results of the method and the generally good agreement between simulated and recorded ground motion from the 17 January 1995 Kobe earthquake shown in this study indicate that the technique has the capability of reproducing the main characteristics of near-fault ground motion.},

  Abstract                 = {EURO-SEISTEST is a European test site established in the Mygdonian basin, near Thessaloniki, in Northern Greece. Its aim is to allow detailed and well documented studies in many fields of engineering seismology, earthquake engineering, soil dynamics and seismology. Theoretical and experimental seismic ground response analysis along the valley is one of the most important tasks of the project. The very detailed knowledge of the geological and geotechnical structure of the site as well as numerous data from a continuous seismological and geodetical survey and dense semi-permanent and permanent instrumentation, offer the possibility of conducting detailed empirical and theoretical studies on the effects of surface geology on seismic ground motion. EURO-SEISTEST is a unique test site for checking the reliability of existing theoretical models of site effects, to develop new ones, ana to interpret the physics of seismic ground response. The paper presents: (a) the general layout of the test site, (b) the main results of the extensive geophysical and geotechnical surveys, to determining the geometry and the dynamic properties of soil formations, and (c) the validation of valley's structure with instrumental estimates of the site effects along the valley. Emphasis is given to comparisons and correlations between results derived from different methods of seismic prospection (refraction, surface wave inversion, borehole seismics) and geotechnical in situ tests. In order to better constrain the structure of the valley and the dynamic properties of the soil formations, specific criteria and procedures are developed for soil characterisation.},

  Abstract                 = {Physical models that can be used to obtain realistic accelerograms usually require a thorough knowledge of the source, path, and site effects. In addition, the computational resources needed might be expensive. Thus, empirical models still represent a good alternative for simulating strong ground motion. In this work, we modify and improve the model developed by Sabetta and Pugliese (1996). This new method models the time-domain accelerogram based on the assumption that the phase is random and that the time envelope can be represented by the so-called average instantaneous power. This is, in turn, described as a lognormal distribution for P and S waves combined with an algebro-exponential function representing the envelope of coda waves. In addition, the frequency content of the signal is nonstationary and follows a modified{omega} -square model. The method depends on four common indicators in earthquake engineering: peak ground acceleration, strong-motion duration, Arias intensity, and central frequency. These indicators are empirically connected to a given database by means of ground-motion prediction equations. In this study we calibrate the model using Japanese data recorded by the K-net array, which has high-quality digital accelerograms and station-site conditions characterized by geotechnical measurements. In addition, this technique permits the inclusion of the uncertainty of the model parameters to take into account the ground-motion natural variability in the stochastic generation of the time histories. The main goal of this work is to provide the earthquake engineering community with a flexible tool to generate realistic accelerograms for dynamic studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Soils consist of an assemblage of particles with different sizes and shapes which form a skeleton whose voids are filled with water and air or gas. The word "soil", therefore, implies a mixture of assorted mineral grains with various fluids. When free or no drainage conditions prevail, a single phase description of soil behavior is adequate. However, in intermediate cases in which some flow can take place, there is an interaction between the skeleton strains and the water flow. The solutions of these problems require that soil behavior be analyzed by incorporating the effects of the transient flow of the pore-fluids through the voids, and, therefore, requires that a multiphase formulation be available for porous media. Such a theory was first proposed by Biot, early in 1955, for a linear elastic and a linear visco-elastic porous medium. However, it is observed experimentally that the stress-strain-strength behavior of the soil skeleton is strongly non-linear, anisotropic, elastoplastic and path-dependent. An extension of Biot's theory into the nonlinear anelastic range is, therefore, necessary in order to analyze the transient response of soil deposits. This extension has acquired considerable importance in recent years due to the increased concern with the dynamic behavior of saturated soil deposits and associated liquifaction of saturated sand deposits under seismic loading conditions. Such an extension of Biot's formulation is proposed herein.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in digital computer technology and in numerical techniques such as the finite difference or the finite element methods, have rendered possible, at least in principle, the solution of any properly posed boundary value problems in soil mechanics. Further progress in expanding analytical capabilities in geomechanics depends upon consistent mathematical formulations of generally valid and realistic material constitutive relations. An increasing effort has thus been devoted since the 1960's to a more comprehensive description of soil behavior. Numerous formulations have been proposed in the soil mechanics literature. All rely on a better knowledge and understanding of mechanics in general, and continuum mechanics in particular, than has been common in traditional soil mechanics training. The results and progress in the field of constitutive relations have thus until recently been mostly ignored by the mainstream of soil engineering. However, recent progress and honest validation exercises have instilled confidence and finally attracted the attention of the practice. We should therefore see in the future more impact on the practice of this area of soil mechanics.

It is the purpose of this paper to provide an overview of soil constitutive models and related issues. The review is brief and makes no attempt to be exhaustive. In recent years, the growing interest in constitutive relations has led to a number of conferences devoted exclusively to theoretical, experimental, numerical implementations and application problems associated with this field. It would have been impossible to record all the papers and discuss all the models that have been proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {The October 6/2000 Tottori earthquake that occurred in central Japan was an intermediate size strike-slip event that produced a very large number of near field strong motion recordings. The large amount of recorded data provides a unique opportunity for investigating a source asperity model of the Tottori earthquake that, combined with a hybrid strong motion simulation technique, is able to reproduce the observed broadband frequency near-fault ground motion. We investigated the optimum source asperity parameters of the Tottori earthquake, by applying a Genetic Algorithm (GA) inversion scheme to optimise the fitting between simulated and observed response spectra and Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) values. We constrained the initial model of our inversion by using the heterogeneous slip distribution obtained from a kinematic inversion of the source of previous studies. We used all the observed near-fault ground motions (-100 m) from the borehole strong motion network of Japan (KiK-Net), which are little affected by surficial geology (site effects). The calculation of broadband frequency strong ground motion (0.1-10 Hz) is achieved by applying a hybrid technique that combines a deterministic simulation of the wave propagation for the low frequencies and a semi-stochastic modelling approach for the high frequencies. For the simulation of the high frequencies, we introduce a frequency-dependent radiation pattern model that efficiently removes the dependence of the pattern coefficient on the azimuth and take-off angle as the frequency increases. The good agreement between the observed and simulated broadband ground motions shows that our inversion procedure is successful in estimating the optimum asperity parameters of the Tottori earthquake and provides a good test for the strong ground motion simulation technique. The ratio of background stress drop to average asperity stress drop from our inversion is nearly 50 percent, in agreement with the theoretical asperity model of Das and Kostrov [Das, S., Kostrov, B.V., 1986. Fracture of a single asperity on a finite fault: a model for weak earthquakes? Earthquake Source Mechanics, AGU, pp. 91-96.], and an empirical ratio of asperities to rupture area [Seismol. Res. Lett. 70 (1999) 59-80.]. The simulated radiation pattern is very complex for epicentral distances within half the fault length, but it approaches the radiation of a double-couple point source for larger distances. The rupture velocity and rise time have a significant influence on the Peak Ground Velocity (PGV) distribution around the fault. An increase in rupture velocity produces a similar effect on the ground motion as a reduction in rise time.}

  Abstract                 = {Euroseistest is currently the longest running test site in the world. It was originally defined as the 2D cross-section of the Mygdonian basin going from Profitis to Stivos villages. In this paper, we present the first results of the effort to extend the idea of test site to a larger portion of the whole sedimentary structure, i.e. the extension of the idea of Euroseistest from a 2D to a 3D structure. To this end we have compiled available geological and geotechnical information. We have analyzed microtremor and earthquake data recorded seven years ago, that had not been thoroughly exploited. We present the results of the analysis of H/V spectral ratios from microtremors recorded at 195 sites, and from earthquake records at 14 stations. The results are validated through comparison with the well studied 2D cross-section. In addition to this, the geometry of the edges of the basin has been deduced from electrical tomographies. The synthesis of all these data allowed us to propose reliable map of dominant frequencies throughout the basin, a good constrain on the geometry of the basin at the edges, and shear-wave velocity profiles at some points. Our results indicate that average shear-wave velocity is not constant throughout, and thus the dominant frequency map is not a faithful image of the geometry of the basin. We have also obtained a reliable estimate of the site response throughout the basin. The results have been used to plan an additional measurement campaign, and are currently used to compute site response using a 3D seismic modelling code. We expect that the usefulness of Euroseistest to understand site effects in 3D geological structures will be as large as it has been in its 2D phase.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, the United States Geologic Survey Earthquake Hazards Program developed a 3D seismic velocity model of Northern California based on geology, including a detailed model of the urbanized San Francisco Bay Area. In this study, we report comparisons of observed three-component broadband (0.03-0.25-Hz) waveforms with synthetic seismograms computed with the new 3D model using an elastic finite difference method. We selected a set of 12 moderate earthquakes (Mw 4.0-5.1) that occurred within the greater San Francisco Bay Area, having well-constrained source parameters and broadband recordings with high signal-to-noise ratios. The objective of this study was to investigate how well the 3D velocity model predicts observed waveforms and to identify features of the model that may require revision to improve the waveform fits and predictions of ground motions for future events. We show for the 3 September 2000 Yountville earthquake that reported source parameters accurately predict waveforms at two close strong-motion stations (approximately 10 km from the epicenter). By comparing synthetics for the average 1D model GIL7 (Stidham et al., 1999) and the 3D structures we show that the effects of seismic wave propagation in the 3D model become important for frequencies at and above 0.1 Hz (periods less than 10 sec). Comparison of observed and synthetic seismograms for the 3D model consistently shows that the model predicts energy arriving earlier than is observed, particularly for the surface waves, indicating that the shear velocities in the upper crust must be reduced. We cross correlated the observed and synthetic waveforms and recorded the delay time and linear correlation for best alignment of the data and delayed synthetic. The results indicate that generally the 3D model predicts the observed waveforms well (mean linear correlations 0.41) and includes features that arise from the interaction of the wave field with 3D structure, especially the major sedimentary basins in San Pablo Bay, San Francisco Bay, Santa Clara Valley, and Livermore Valley. Simple conversion of the observed delay times for optimal alignment suggests shear velocities should be reduced by 4--5 percent on average. Based on these findings, we conclude that the model is an excellent first step, suggesting that the overall structure of the model is accurate (i.e., the basin and discontinuity geometry). However, the velocities must be reduced to improve the observed timing of surface-wave arrivals.},

  Abstract                 = {The stochastic method for simulating strong ground motions from finite faults is applied to the records of the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquake. The method involves discretization of the fault plane into smaller subfaults, each of which is assigned an x2 spectrum. The contributions from all subfaults are empirically attenuated to the observation site and summed to produce the synthetic acceleration time history. The method is initially calibrated against the data recorded at 24 rock sites, located within 7-120 km from the mainshock hypocenter and providing a broad azimuthal coverage of the fault plane. The accuracy of the simulations is quantified through the model bias, defined as the logarithm of the ratio of the observed to simulated spectrum, averaged over all stations. The calibrated model for the Chi-Chi event has a near-zero average bias in reproducing the ground motions at rock sites in the frequency range from 0.1 to 20 Hz. An unusually low value is found for the radiation-strength factor s, controlling the high-frequency radiation level and directly related to the maximum slip velocity on the fault, compared with the mean value found for North American earthquakes. This result reflects the observed low peak ground accelerations of the Chi-Chi mainshock and, physically, its lower-than-usual slip velocities. The calibrated model is then used to simulate soil-site (site class D) records using the linear-response assumption. The simulated soil-site input motions are amplified by the weak-motion amplification functions, estimated by the spectral-ratio technique from available aftershock records. This analysis reveals an average reduction in strong-motion amplification to about 0.5-0.6 of that in weak motions, with an acceleration "threshold" for detectable nonlinearity near 200-300 cm/sec2. However, the derivation of soil-site specific weak-motion amplification was limited by the amount of aftershock data available; further improvement in the quantification of nonlinear soil response during the Chi-Chi earthquake may be possible with the release of additional aftershock datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {The stochastic method for finite faults is applied to simulate strong ground motion from the 7 September 1999, moment magnitude M 5.9 Athens earthquake. The method includes descritization of the fault plane into a certain number of subfaults, each of which is assigned an{omega} -2 spectrum. A slip-distribution model, derived from previous studies of this earthquake, is used to specifically account for the source effect. Contributions from all subfaults are then empirically attenuated to the observation sites, where they are summed to produce the synthetic acceleration time history. The method is first calibrated against its ability of reproducing the recordings at 19 strong-motion stations, at epicentral distances ranging from 16 to 61 km. The calibrated model is then applied to calculate synthetics at a large number of grid points covering the area around the fault plane. Simulated peak values are subsequently used to produce synthetic peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration maps at hard rock. Both peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration maps imply energy directivity toward the east, where most of the damage was concentrated. The directivity effect is most prominent at large periods (>2 sec) and in the period range 0.2 to 0.3 sec. Independent geotechnical studies showed considerable site effect at periods <0.5 sec within the meizoseismal area. This result, coupled with the results of the present study, imply that the damage distribution pattern of the 1999 Athens earthquake can be explained by the destructive combination of two factors: the source directivity and the site effect.},

  Abstract                 = {We exploit 55 repeating microearthquake sequences on the San Andreas Fault, just south of the rupture zone of the 1989 $M_{\mathrm{W}}$ 6.9 Loma Prieta Earthquake, to search for time-dependent properties of the Earth's crust. Using moving window waveform cross correlation, we identify clear and systematic delays as large as 20 msec for the direct $S$ wave and exceeding 50 msec in the early $S$-wave coda following the Loma Prieta mainshock. Others have also identified phase delays (velocity reductions) associated with damaging earthquakes and they have suggested a myriad of possible causal mechanisms. Here, we present new evidence for a mechanism to produce velocity reductions correlated in time and space with an earthquake. A strong correlation between the spatial patterns of $S$ delays and the intensity of strong ground motion in the Loma Prieta Earthquake suggests that physical damage, the formation or growth of cracks during strong ground motion, to the Earth's shallow crust is responsible for the observed velocity reductions. The strong spatial variability in $S$ delays over short distances and the strong correlation of the magnitude of delays with surface geology indicate that the phase delays accumulate primarily near the receiver. The effect is stronger at stations on young, soft rocks than at stations on old, hard rock. Disproportionately larger $S$ coda delays than $P$ coda delays suggest that the cracks formed by the strong shaking are fluid filled. In the 10 years after Loma Prieta, the initial increase in travel times reduces logarithmically with respect to time, often back to the premainshock levels. We attribute this behavior to the same ``slow dynamic'' healing observed in laboratory studies of the recovery of materials from transient nonlinear strain.},

In addition to large delays caused by the Loma Prieta mainshock, the ML 5.4 Chittenden earthquake, an aftershock of Loma Prieta, caused direct S wave delays of up to 6ms and S coda delays exceeding 15ms. We attribute the delays to cracks formed or opened during the strong shaking of the Chittenden earthquake, the same mechanism believed responsible for the delays observed following Loma Prieta. The magnitude of the delays caused by Chittenden strongly correlate with those caused by Loma Prieta. This suggests that rocks recently damaged by nonlinear strong ground motion are particularly susceptible to further damage until they are completely healed. Therefore, we expect that the onset of nonlinearity will occur at substantially lower ground motion for large aftershocks than would otherwise be anticipated.},

Using a moving window cross-correlation technique, we identify delays in the arrival time of seismic waves that accumulate linearly with time into the seismogram. This behavior is indicative of multiple scattering within a medium where the seismic velocity has been reduced. For all of our earthquake-receiver geometries, we find evidence of significant velocity reductions close to the receiver. The correlation of the size of the velocity reductions with both strong shaking and site characteristics suggests that these velocity reductions are caused by damage to near-surface materials created by nonlinear strong ground motion. For earthquake/receiver geometries where the seismic waves cross the Tokachi-Oki rupture zone, we identify particularly large reductions in velocity as a result of the earthquake. For these geometries, we believe that the rupture zone of the Tokachi-Oki earthquake or the shallow crust above it represents a second region where seismic velocities are reduced as a result of the main shock.},

  Abstract                 = {Transpressional tectonics are typically associated with restraining bends on major active strike-slip faults, resulting in uplift and steep terrain. This produces dynamic erosional and depositional conditions and difficulties for established lines of palaeoseismological investigation. Consequently, in these areas data are lacking to determine tectonic behaviour and future hazard potential along these important fault segments. The Big Bend of the San Andreas fault in the Transverse Ranges of southern California exemplifies these problems. However, landslides, probably seismically triggered, are widespread in the rugged terrain of the Big Bend. Fluvial reworking of these deposits rapidly produces geomorphic planes and lines that are markers for subsequent fault slip. The most useful are offset and abandoned stream channels, for these are relatively high precision markers for identifying individual faulting events. Palaeoseismological studies from the central Big Bend, involving 14C ages of charcoal fragments from trench exposures, illustrate these points and indicate that the past three faulting events, including the great 1857 earthquake, were relatively similar in scale, each producing offsets of about 7-7.5 m. The mean recurrence interval is 140-220 years. The pre-1857 event here may be the 1812 event documented south of the Big Bend or an event which took place probably between 1630 and 1690. Ground breakage in both events extended south of the Big Bend, unlike the 1857 event where rupture was skewed to the north. The preceding faulting event ruptured both to the north and south of the Big Bend and probably occurred between 1465 and 1495. All these events centred on the Big Bend and may be typical for this fault segment, suggesting that models of uniform long-term slip rates may not be applicable to the south-central San Andreas. A slip-rate estimate of 34-51 mm a- 1 for the central Big Bend, although uncertain, may also imply higher slip in the Big Bend and highlights difficulties in correlating slip-rates between sites with different tectonic settings. Slip rates on the San Andreas may increase within the broad compressional tectonics zone of the Big Bend, compared to the north and south where the plate boundary is a relatively linear and sub-parallel series of dominantly strike-slip faults. Partitioning slip within the Big Bend is inherently uncertain and insufficient suitably comparable data are available to sustain a uniform slip model, although such models are a common working assumption.},

  Abstract                 = {On 26 December 2004, a devastating earthquake of M 9.3 occurred offshore northern Sumatra. Due to the size of this earthquake and the accompanying tsunami wave, disastrous consequences have been observed in several countries around the Indian Ocean. The tectonics in the region are characterized by the oblique, north-northeast-oriented subduction of the Indian-Australian plate under the Sunda microplate with a rate of 6-6.5 cm/yr. This oblique convergence results in strain partitioning, where the trench-perpendicular thrust faulting along the subducting slab accommodates the east-west component of the motion, whereas the north-south component of the motion is probably accommodated by the right-lateral strike-slip faulting along the Great Sumatran fault and the Mentawi fault. Source parameters of the 26 December 2004 event have been used for modeling the resulting ground motions in the nearby affected regions. Results give an insight on the importance of ground shaking in the total destruction of places like Banda Aceh, northern Sumatra, Indonesia. The modeling is performed for a multiasperity finite fault using a hybrid procedure combining deterministic modeling at low frequencies and semistochastic modeling at high frequencies. Results show that strong shaking was distributed over a large area including northwestern Sumatra and its offshore islands. In Banda Aceh, which experienced significant damage, bedrock velocities reached 60 cm/sec with duration of the shaking of ca. 150 sec. The largest ground motions occurred near the strongest asperities of the fault plane, where velocities of 200 cm/sec are modeled for bedrock conditions.},

It is used to compute the seismic response of three-dimensional alluvial valleys under incident P, S, and Rayleigh waves. The method is based on the integral representations for scattered elastic waves using single-layer boundary sources. This approach is called indirect BEM in the literature as the sources strengths should be obtained as an intermediate step. Scattered waves are constructed at the boundaries from which they radiate. Therefore, this method can be regarded as a numerical realization of Huygens' principle. Boundary conditions lead to a system of integral equations for boundary sources. A simplified discretization scheme is used. It is based on the approximate rectification of the surfaces involved using circles for the numerical and analytical integration of the exact Green's function for the unbounded elastic space. Various examples are given for three-dimensional problems of scattering and diffraction of elastic waves by soft elastic inclusion models of alluvial deposits in an elastic half-space. Results are displayed in both frequency and time domains. These results show the significant influence of locally generated surface waves in seismic response, and they evince three-dimensional effects.},

The model is a hybrid defined by high-resolution velocity data sets from industry reflection seismic surveys, geophysical well measurements, and analytic velocity functions derived from well and refraction seismic data . The model is embedded into the regional tomographic model of Hauksson (2000). The CVM-H consists of several higher and lower resolution volumes, as well as two surfaces used to define the volume of sediments (the top pre-cretaceous basement and topography/bathymetry). Major improvements in this version of the model include a new faulted basement surface that is compatible with the positions and offsets on major fault systems represented in the CFM, and a new high-resolution velocity model in the Salton Trough. A simple program interface, which is available through our website, allows retrieving velocities and densities from a list of geographic coordinates and depth values (http://wacke.harvard.edu:8080/HUSCV/). The model has been successfully applied in various ground motion simulations (Komatitsch et al. 2004; Lovely et al., in press), and will be available through the SCEC/CME Velocity Model Server.}

  Abstract                 = {Utilizing a crustal velocity model that includes the complexity of the irregular subsurface structure of the Kanto basin, we have performed three-dimensional (3D) finite-difference (FD) simulations of near-source long-period strong ground motions in the Tokyo metropolitan area for the 1990 Odawara (MJ 5.1) and the 1923 Kanto (MS 8.2) earthquakes. Constraints on the development of the 3D velocity model come from available geological and geophysical data, as well as our previous 1D waveform modeling results (Sato et al., 1998a). The simulation of the moderate-sized Odawara earthquake demonstrates that the 3D velocity model works quite well at reproducing the recorded long-period (T > 3.33 sec) strong motions, including basin-generated surface waves, for a number of sites located throughout the Kanto basin region. Using this validated 3D model along with the variable-slip rupture model of Wald and Somerville (1995), we then simulate the long-period (T > 4 sec) ground motions in this region for the 1923 Kanto earthquake. The simulation results for the 1923 event show that the largest ground motions occur east of the epicenter along the central and southern part of the Boso Peninsula. These large motions arise from strong rupture directivity effects and are comprised of relatively simple, source-controlled pulses with a dominant period of about 10 sec. North of the epicentral region, in the Tokyo area, 3D basin-generated phases are quite significant, and these phases produce large-amplitude late-arriving pulses in the ground motions. At station Hongo (HNG), which is the only site having digitized and restored near-fault strong-motion records for this event, our 3D simulations compare quite well with the ground motions of the restored Imamura seismogram. For the restored Ewing record, our 3D simulations reproduce the phase and amplitude of the initial pulses of motion; however, the dominant period of the large-amplitude later phases is noticeably shorter in the simulations (about 5 to 6 sec) than in the observation (13 sec). These results suggest that the restored Imamura seismogram may be a better representation of the gross features of the actual motion than the restored Ewing seismogram, although the first (clipped and restored) part of the Imamura seismogram may still underestimate the strength of the actual motion.},

In a previous, we estimated S-wave velocity structures above the pre-Tertiary bedrock at six sites in the Sendai basin based on array records of microtremors. To interpolate these velocity structures in space we conduct single-station microtremor measurements at a total of 61 locations and estimate the S-wave velocity structure at each site by modeling the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio of fundamental mode Rayleigh waves. An initial 3D model of the basin is constructed using the velocity structures estimated from both array and single-station microtremor measurements, along with other information such as surface geology. This model encompasses a region 33 km long, 30 km wide, and 19 km deep. The final model is obtained through a trial-and-error process by fitting 3D FD synthetic waveforms to the bandpass-filtered (0.2 Hz to 1.67 Hz) displacement records 12 stations for the 1998 Miyagiken-Nanbu earthquake. We compute the synthetics using a fourth-order staggered-grid 3D FD method with variable grid spacing. As the 3D model is modified, the source parameters (strike, dip, rake, and seismic moment) are estimated by a grid search method using 1D site-specific models derived from the modified 3D model. The observed waveforms are reproduced well at most stations by the final 3D basin model. This agreement suggests the validity of the final 3D basin model for theoretical strong-motion prediction of large earthquakes in the frequency range from 0.2 to 1.67 Hz.},

  Abstract                 = {We evaluate the nonlinear behavior of soil sediments during strong ground shaking based on the identification of their S-wave velocities and damping factors for both the weak and strong motions observed on the surface and in a borehole at Kuno in the Ashigara Valley, Japan. First we calculate spectral ratios between the surface station KS2 and the borehole station KD2 at 97.6 m below the surface for the main part of weak and strong motions. The predominant period for the strong motion is apparently longer than those for the weak motions. This fact suggests the nonlinearity of soil during the strong ground shaking. To quantify the nonlinear behavior of soil sediments, we identify their S-wave velocities and damping factors by minimizing the residual between the observed spectral ratio and the theoretical amplification factor calculated from the one-dimensional wave propagation theory. The $S$-wave velocity and the damping factor $h$ ($\approx(2Q)^{-1}$) of the surface alluvial layer identified from the main part of the strong motion are about 10 percent smaller and 50 percent greater, respectively, than those identified from weak motions. The relationships between the effective shear strain (=65 percent of the maximum shear strain) calculated from the one-dimensional wave propagation theory and the shear modulus reduction ratios or the damping factors estimated by the identification method agree well with the laboratory test results. We also confirm that the soil model identified from a weak motion overestimates the observed strong motion at KS2, while that identified from the strong motion reproduces the observed. Thus, we conclude that the main part of the strong motion, whose maximum acceleration at KS2 is 220 cm/sec${}^2$ and whose duration is 3 sec, has the potential of making the surface soil nonlinear at an effective shear strain on the order of 0.1 percent. The $S$-wave velocity in the surface alluvial layer identified from the part just after the main part of the strong motion is close to that identified from weak motions. This result suggests that the shear modulus recovers quickly as the shear strain level decreases.},

  Abstract                 = {Repeating earthquakes that rupture approximately the same fault patch and have nearly identical waveforms are a useful tool for measuring temporal changes in wave propagation in the Earth's crust. Since source and path effects are common to all earthquakes in a repeating earthquake sequence (multiplet), differences in their waveforms can be attributed to changes in the characteristics of the medium. We have identified over 20 multiplets containing between 5 and 40 repeating events in the aftershock zones of the 1989 Loma Prieta and 1984 Morgan Hill, California, earthquakes. Postmain shock events reveal delays of phases in the early S wave coda of as much as 0.2 s relative to premain shock events. The delay amounts to a path-averaged coseismic velocity decrease of about 1.5 percent for P waves and 3.5 percent for S waves. Since most of the multiplets are aftershocks and follow Omori's law, we have excellent temporal sampling in the immediate postmain shock period. We find that the amplitude of the velocity decrease decays logarithmically in time following the main shock. In some cases it returns to the premain shock values, while in others it does not. Similar results are obtained for the Morgan Hill main shock. Because the fractional change in S wave velocity is greater than the fractional change in P wave velocity, it suggests that the opening or connection of fluid-filled fractures is the underlying cause. The magnitude of the velocity change implies that low effective pressures are present in the source region of the velocity change. Our results suggest that the changes are predominantly near the stations and shallow, but we cannot exclude the possibility that changes occur at greater depth as well. If the variations are shallow, we may be detecting the lingering effects of nonlinearity during main shock strong ground motion. If the variations are deep, it suggests that pore pressures at seismogenic depths are high, which would likely play a key role in the earthquake process.},

  Abstract                 = {Large-scale earthquake simulation requires source datasets which describe the highly heterogeneous physical characteristics of the earth in the region under simulation. Physical characteristic datasets are the first stage in a simulation pipeline which includes mesh generation, partitioning, solving, and visualization. In practice, the data is produced in an ad-hoc fashion for each set of experiments, which has several significant shortcomings including lower performance, decreased repeatability and comparability, and a longer time to science, an increasingly important metric.

As a solution to these problems, we propose a new approach for providing scientific data to ground motion simulations, in which ground model datasets are fully materialized into octress stored on disk, which can be more efficiently queried (by up to two orders of magnitude) than the underlying community velocity model programs. While octrees have long been used to store spatial datasets, they have not yet been used at the scale we propose. We further propose that these datasets can be provided as a service, either over the Internet or, more likely, in a datacenter or supercomputing center in which the simulations take place. Since constructing these octrees is itself a challenge, we present three data-parallel techniques for efficiently building them, which can significantly decrease the build time from days or weeks to hours using commodity clusters. This approach typifies a broader shift toward science as a service techniques in which scientific computation and storage services become more tightly intertwined.},

The validity of the approach is tested against the motions recorded at four soil sites and one rock site during the 1957 San Francisco earthquake. The good agreement between the computed and recorded values indicates that rock motions can be computed from motions recorded on soil deposits, and that the computed rock motions in turn can be used to predict the motion that would have been recorded under different soil and geological conditions. The method is also used to evaluate the probable rock motions in the vicinity of El Centro in the earthquake of 1940 and the ground surface motions that could have been developed on various soil conditions in the same general area.},

By 1900, correct equations of plasticity for soils had been proposed, and solutions had been obtained to a number of practical cases by graphical integration. Punch or footing problems were examined in the 1920s. By 1950, the mathematical bases of plasticity for metals were firmly established. Since that time, they have been extended by many investigators to account for the peculiarities of soil behavior, including yielding under hydrostatic stresses. The present state of incremental plasticity theory, necessitating the use of computers for solutions, requires consideration of three basic conditions: A yield criterion, a hardening law, and a flow rule.},

It is shown that the ground response in areas of Mexico City underlain by clay is extremely sensitive to small changes in the shear wave velocity of the clay and it is suggested that a probabilistic approach which allows for uncertainties in shear wave velocity measurements and in the characteristics of the motions on the hard formations is desirable to assess these effects. Based on the results of such an approach it is concluded that simple ground response analyses can provide very useful data for engineering assessments of the effects of local soil conditions on the characteristics of ground motions likely to develop at sites underlain by soft clays, and that the use of these procedures also provides a useful basis for estimating the general nature of the ground motions in the extensive heavy damage zone of Mexico City in the 1985 earthquake.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of site effects is very important since the amplification of seismic motion in some specific areas can be very strong. In this paper, the site considered is located in the centre of Nice on the French Riviera. Site effects are investigated considering a numerical approach (Boundary Element Method) and are compared with experimental results. The experimental results are obtained thanks to real earthquakes (weak motion) and microtremor measurements. The investigation of seismic site effects through numerical approaches is interesting because it shows the dependency of the amplification level on such parameters as wave velocity in surface soil layers, velocity contrast with deep layers, seismic wave type, incidence and damping.

In this specific area of Nice, experimental measurements obtained for weak motion lead to strong site effects. A one-dimensional (1D) analytical analysis of amplification does not give a satisfactory estimation of the maximum reached levels. A boundary element model is then proposed considering different wave types (SH, P, SV) as the seismic loading. The alluvial basin is successively assumed as an isotropic linear elastic medium and an isotropic linear viscoelastic solid with Zener type behaviour (standard solid). The influence of frequency and incidence is analysed. The thickness of the surface layer, its mechanical properties, its general shape as well as the seismic wave type involved have a great influence on the maximum amplification and the frequency for which it occurs. For real earthquakes, the numerical results are in very good agreement with experimental measurements for each motion component. The boundary element method leads to amplification values very close to the actual ones and much larger than those obtained in the 1D case. Two-dimensional basin effects are then very strong and are well reproduced numerically.},

In this work a spectral element method in conjunction with a new iterative solution technique is presented. The very high spatial accuracy of the algorithm allows for increased computational efficiency when compared to standard finite element method. In addition, the use of an iterative solver, based on a local element-by-element formulation and a matrix-vector product which is factored and converted to a faster matrix-matrix product, allows for a significant reduction both in storage requirements and in the computational complexity. The resulting algorithm can easily be implemented on high-performance vector and/or parallel processors. The numerical scheme has been tested on a Cray T3E supercomputer. Our experimental results show that efficiency is very high and that good load balancing can be obtained at run time, because relevant blocks of computations are performed at the element level and are totally independent.},

High accuracy is reached even for rather long wave propagation times and dispersion errors are essentially eliminated; pirregular interfaces between different media can be well described so that numerical artifacts or noises are not at all introduced.

  Abstract                 = {We use global positioning system (GPS) data to study the rupture mechanism of the 1994 Northridge earthquake in southern California. We include data from 62 observation sites, of which two (Palos Verdes and Jet Propulsion Lab) are permanent GPS geodetic array (PGGA) sites. We use a grid-search scheme to study the range of single- and dual-plane, uniform and varied slip models consistent with the data. We find that in order to fit the geodetic data with a fault model whose primary fault patch is confined to a plane through the aftershocks, a secondary fault plane is required above the primary fault plane. The moment release of the secondary fault can be as large as 1.9 x 1018 N-m, 14% of the moment release of the primary fault. This result implies significant deformation in the shallow crust associated with the mainshock. Our preferred model has a 14 x 14 array of dislocation patches on a plane through the main aftershock cluster and a 5 x 6 array of patches in the hanging wall west of the epicenter. We estimate the displacements on the patches by linear inversion with a first-order smoothness constraint. The estimated displacements on the main fault for this model are confined to a simple region between depths of 5 and 18 km, in the interior of the modeled fault surface. The mainshock lies at the bottom of the aftershock zone, near which about 1-m slip is shown on our modeled fault surface. The maximum slip on the fault surface is about 2.2 m, located at 34.28{degrees} N, 118.55{degrees} W, and 12.4 km at depth. The seismic moment release estimate of 1.34 {+/-} 0.15 x 1019 N-m on the main fault at the 95% confidence is consistent with the estimate from strong-motion studies.},

  Abstract                 = {As part of a comprehensive earthquake loss and vulnerability evaluation of the state of South Carolina, ground motions were simulated for a moment magnitude (M) 7.3 "1886 Charleston-like" earthquake using finite-fault and point-source stochastic numerical modeling. The probability for liquefaction was also predicted based on factors of safety computed from average cyclic stress and shear-wave-velocity-based cyclic resistance ratios, clay content, and saturation. Because there is considerable uncertainty regarding the 1886 source, the rupture plane of the 1886 event was modeled as both a 100-km-long, 20-km-wide fault (static stress drop of 27 bars) and a 50-km-long, 16-km-wide fault (107-bar stress drop). The source was assumed to be a north-northeast-striking, strike-slip fault coincident with the Woodstock fault. Based on comparing the computed and observed 1886 liquefaction areas and ground motions for both the low and high stress drop events, the two cases were weighted 0.8 and 0.2, respectively. To accommodate epistemic uncertainty in eastern U.S. earthquake source processes, three region-specific point-source attenuation models were also developed and used: a single-corner frequency model with both a constant stress drop and a magnitude-dependent stress drop, and the double-corner frequency model. The finite-fault and point-source models were weighted 0.8 and 0.2, respectively. To incorporate site effects into the ground-motion estimates, an extensive effort was made to characterize the thicknesses, shear-wave velocities (VS), and dynamic material properties of unconsolidated sediments. Characteristic VS profiles were developed using the available subsurface information, which incorporated a wide range of soil and rock conditions. Amplification factors were computed for four site response categories, each of which were a function of soil thickness, input hard-rock motion, and spectral frequency. From the five weighted stochastic ground-motion models (two finite fault and three point source) and amplification factors, rock and soil ground motions were computed to produce statewide ground-motion maps for the M 7.3 scenario event. Weighting of the Charleston source and ground-motion models was implemented so that the resulting liquefaction areas matched the 1886 areas of liquefaction. Peak horizontal ground acceleration (PGA) values as high as 0.6g-0.7g were estimated in the vicinity of the modeled rupture. PGAs in the range of 0.3g-0.4g were estimated for Charleston consistent with the observed building damage and liquefaction. Significant ground shaking (PGA > 0.2g) extends out to distances of 50-60 km. Strong long-period ([&ge;]1.0 sec) ground motions are predicted throughout the state. The probabilities for liquefaction were highest in the epicentral region (>50 percent), consistent with the observed occurrences of liquefaction in 1886.},

We conduct a parametric study using Hercules, the parallel octree-based finite element earthquake simulator developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie Mellon University. Because of the necessity of performing repeated ground motion simulations , our analysis is based on the Domain Reduction Method (DRM), a modular two-step finite element methodology for modeling earthquake ground motion in highly heterogeneous localized regions. Buildings are included by modifying Hercules' finite-element meshing routines so that they are incorporated as additional block elements that are adjusted to emulate the general geometric and dynamic characteristics of buildings in city-like arrangements. We conduct our study in the greater Los Angeles basin using the main shock of 1994 Northridge earthquake for frequencies up to 2 Hz and a domain size of 85x85x42.5 km3 as the first step of the DRM. Then, we reduce the size of the region to a small subdomain of 2x2x1 km3 within the downtown Los Angeles region and introduce the building structures, for the second step of the DRM, in order to perform the repeated simulations of the parametric study.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary The finite element method is shown to be a powerful tool for the numerical modelling of seismic body wave propagation problems. Applications extend to both problems on a scale of interest to engineers and also to large-scale seismological problems. Solutions are sought in the time domain. Efficient programs have been written to accomplish this. The scope of numerical solutions has been greatly enhanced by the use of a previously reported scheme for exactly cancelling reflections at the boundaries of the model. The finite difference results of Boore and the analytical results of Trifunac for the amplification due to a mountain and an alluvial valley respectively are compared with new finite element results. The new results agree well, although there are some difficulties with resonance in the alluvial valley problem. Boore's SH results have been extended to vertical P and SV incidence. A deep earthquake zone has been modelled realistically in two dimensions and earthquakes simulated at depth. It is suggested that the variation in observed amplitude across the top of the zone, due to refraction away from the slab, may be used to provide an estimate of the thickness of the slab from long-period observations of local earthquakes.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study is to develop and test a procedure for simulating acceleration time histories of large subduction earthquakes. The ground motions of the large event are obtained by summing contributions from fault elements to simulate the propagation of rupture over the fault surface. The radiation from the fault elements is represented by empirical source functions derived from near-source strong motion recordings of Mw = 7 aftershocks, and gross aspects of wave propagation are modeled by calculated Green's functions. The procedure has been tested against the recorded strong ground motions of the Mw = 8.0 Michoacan, Mexico, and Valparaiso, Chile, earthquakes of 1985. We find that models of heterogeneous slip in these events derived by other investigators from the analysis of teleseismic and near-source velocity seismograms also explain the shorter period motions of the recorded accelerograms. The response spectra of the simulated motions generally have little or no significant bias in the period range of 0.05 to 2 sec for both earthquakes. Also, the peak accelerations, durations, and envelope shapes of the time histories are in good agreement with the recorded motions. The uncertainty associated with the modeling procedure, estimated from the misfit between recorded and simulated response spectra, shows a dependence on period and site conditions. This uncertainty estimate includes the uncertainty involved in using empirical source functions derived from one subduction zone to simulate strong ground motions in another subduction zone. The procedure is applied in a companion paper (Cohee et al., 1991) to estimate strong ground motion characteristics in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States from hypothesized Mw = 8 subduction earthquakes on the Cascadia plate interface.},

A missing link, however, has been an improved and empirically verified treatment of soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects on both the strong motions transmitted to structures and the structural response to these motions. This paper describes analysis procedures and system identification techniques for evaluating inertial SSI effects on seismic structural response. The analysis procedures are similar to provisions in some building codes but incorporate more rationally the influence of site conditions and the foundation embedment, flexibility, and shape on foundation impedance. Implementation of analysis procedures and system identification techniques is illustrated using a building shaken during the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The analysis procedures predict the observed SSI effects accurately. A companion paper applies these analyses to empirically evaluate SSI effects using available strong motion data from a broad range of sites and then develops general conclusions regarding SSI effects on seismic structural excitation and response.},

  Abstract                 = {System identification analyses are used to evaluate soil-structure interaction effects for 77 strong motion data sets at 57 building sites that encompass a wide range of structural and geotechnical conditions. Kinematic interaction effects on the ``input'' motion at the bases of structures are found to be relatively modest in many cases, whereas inertial interaction effects on the structural response to these motions can be significant. To quantify inertial interaction effects, fixed- and flexible-base modal vibration parameters are used to evaluate first-mode period lengthening ratios T.hat/T and foundation damping factors Xi.0. The response of some structures is dominated by inertial interaction, whereas others undergo negligible soil-structure interaction. Simplified analytical formulations described in the companion paper by Stewart et al. are used to predict inertial interaction effects. The predictions are found to be reasonably accurate relative to empirical results, with some limitations for deeply embedded and long-period structures. A collective examination of the empirical and predicted results reveals a pronounced influence of structure-to-soil stiffness ratio on inertial interaction, as well as secondary influences from structure aspect ratio and foundation embedment, type, shape, and flexibility.}

The latter method may also be extended to treat three-dimensional problems. Pore pressure transients are investigated in a one-dimensional approach based on Darcy's law. By prescribing reductions of void ratios as a function of time, zones of potential liquefaction may be identified and their movement traced. By use of a lattice work representation, transient pore pressure within the upstream portion of an earth dam are investigated.},

  Abstract                 = {The main objective of this thesis is to build a framework for performing earthquake simulations capable of including nonlinear soil behavior and the presence of the built environment in highly heterogeneous basins, and to study their influence on the final response of the ground in large urban areas exposed to high seismic hazard. To this end, we use a finite elements approach and extend the capabilities of Hercules, the parallel octree-based earthquake simulator developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie Mellon.

Nonlinear soil behavior is incorporated in ground motion simulations employing a rate-dependent plasticity approach to predict the nonlinear state of the material explicitly at every time step. The soil is modeled as a perfectly elastoplastic material. The presence of urban structures is modeled representing buildings as homogeneous blocks made up of the same type of hexahedral elements used in the mesh. These elements are generated automatically through a new set of application programming interfaces, which extend Hercules' meshing capabilities while preserving its core octree-based formulation.

Both implementations are tested under realistic earthquake conditions in heterogeneous geological structures. In the case of nonlinear ground motion modeling, results indicate that soil nonlinearities greatly modify the ground response, confirming previous observations for deamplification effects and spatial variability, and evidencing three-dimensional basin effects not fully observed before. In turn, the presence of building clusters causes multiple soil-structure interaction phenomena that change both the near ground-motion and the individual performance of the buildings themselves. This substantiates the argument that in soft-soil basins may it not be longer valid to ignore the presence of neighboring structures.

These new implementations represent important advances in computational seismology and help make a direct connection to subjects of interest in earthquake engineering. The analysis drawn from the applications presented here confirms aspects known from previous, though limited studies, and broadens our knowledge of the effects of nonlinear soil and the built environment on the ground motion due to earthquakes at a regional level not explored before.}

  Abstract                 = {Physics-based, deterministic earthquake simulations using numerical methods and high-performance computing have gained increased acceptance within the seismologic and earthquake engineering communities in recent years. Large-scale simulations are used as a means for understanding ground motion characteristics and seismic hazard of entire regions. Their level of detail, however, has been predominantly limited to long-periods, with most verification and validation studies using maximum simulation frequencies lower than or equal to 1 Hz, and minimum shear wave velocities greater than or equal to 500 m/s. We present a simulation of the Mw 5.4 2008 Chino Hills earthquake for a maximum frequency up to 4 Hz and a minimum shear wave velocity down to 200 m/s, and perform a validation study comparing data obtained from seismic networks with simulation synthetics on more than 300 recording stations. The simulation was done using Hercules, the parallel octree-based finite-element earthquake simulator developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie Mellon University. The source model corresponds to that of an independent inversion study and the material model used is a Community Velocity Model developed by the Southern California Earthquake Center. Our results show (i) strong sensitivity of the ground motion to the velocities of the shallow layers, especially at the higher frequencies; (ii) that extending the maximum frequency beyond 1 Hz for deterministic earthquake simulations is an effort worth pursuing; and (iii) suggest areas where future improvement of seismic velocity and source models is required.}

  Abstract                 = {We present our recent developments in ground motion modeling for including full three-dimensional nonlinear soil behavior and the presence of the built environment in large-scale earthquake simulations in highly heterogeneous basins, and illustrate their effects with a scenario earthquake. These additions to our simulation framework are implemented in Hercules, the parallel octree-based finite-element earthquake simulator developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie Mellon. Our new implementation is applicable to both long- and shorter-period earthquake ground motions. It helps make a direct connection to subjects of interest in earthquake engineering and seismology, such as seismic hazard assessment in large urban areas, path and site effects, and the analysis and design of sensitive infrastructure and tall buildings. Nonlinear soil behavior is incorporated in ground motion simulations employing a rate-dependent plasticity approach to predict the nonlinear state of the material explicitly at every time step. At this initial stage, the soil is modeled as a perfectly elastoplastic material. The presence of urban structures is modeled by representing buildings as homogeneous blocks made up of the same type of hexahedral elements used in the finite-element mesh. We test our extended simulation capabilities for soil nonlinearity and site-city effects under realistic earthquake conditions in a heterogeneous geological structure. In the case of nonlinear ground motion modeling, results indicate that soil nonlinearities greatly modify the ground response, confirming previous observations of deamplification effects and spatial variability, and evidencing three-dimensional basin effects not previously visible through idealized one- and two-dimensional approximations. In turn, the presence of building clusters causes multiple soil-structure interaction phenomena that change both the near ground motion and the individual behavior of the buildings themselves. This substantiates the argument that in soft-soil basins it may no longer be valid to ignore the presence of neighboring structures. The analysis drawn from the applications presented here confirms aspects known from previous, though limited studies, and broadens our knowledge of the effects of nonlinear soil and the built environment on the ground motion due to earthquakes, at a regional level explored here for the first time.}

In this first study we have modeled the soil using the von Mises and Drucker-Prager constitutive equations. We test this new implementation in a realistic basin filled with three layers of soft-soil deposits with shear wave velocities 200, 350, 650 m/s resting on a bedrock of Vs = 2600 m/s. The material within the basin is allowed to deform plastically while the bedrock substrata remains elastic throughout the simulation. Results indicate that there exist 3D effects that cannot be modeled using approximate 2D or 1D approaches. Typical observations from past earthquakes such as permanent deformations, change in the distribution of energy in the frequency domain (reductions in low frequencies and increase of high frequencies), deamplification factors of velocity and accelerations, are all present. In addition, we observe 3D basin, edge, and directivity effects that do not necessarily follow the same patters of linear anelastic simulations. We believe that including the nonlinearity effects of soils in large earthquake ground motion simulations is a key ingredient toward the advancement of computational seismology as a tool for improving seismic hazard analysis of earthquake-prone regions. The present implementation and results are a step forward in that direction.}

  Abstract                 = {Using Hercules---the octree-based finite-element earthquake simulator developed by the Quake group at Carnegie Mellon University---we have implemented new computational modules that allow us to incorporate large inventories of idealized buildings in earthquake simulations at scale, using parallel supercomputers. The buildings and their foundation systems are modeled as rectangular prismatic blocks filled with homogeneous material whose properties are set so that the fundamental dynamic properties of the real structures are matched on average. These models consist of the same solid finite-elements as those used for the crust and basin structure of the simulation domain and they are in full contact with the soil. We test our implementation with an inventory of 74 buildings placed near the edge of a realistic basin. Results indicate that the presence of the built environment greatly affects the area up to a perimeter of about 300 to 500 meters around the 'city' boundaries. Within the city, the ground motion exhibits significant changes in the spatial variability of peak response and reductions in the excitations at the base of the buildings. Synthetics exhibit shifts in both the time and the frequency domains. The structural response, in general, is reduced due to soil-structure interaction effects. This study suggests that larger inventories of buildings may have the potential of drastically changing the local and regional ground response and confirms results obtained in previous similar 2D studies.}

  Abstract                 = {Thanks to the continuous growth of computational capabilities and advances in modeling methodologies, seismologists and engineers are now able to simulate strong ground motion at a scale and frequency-level never envisioned before. Most of these simulations, however, continue to be done considering linear soil conditions. Although nonlinear soil behavior was largely debated for decades, its occurrence during moderate to large earthquakes has now been widely acknowledged, especially due to the evidence gathered after events like the Loma Prieta, 1989 and Northridge, 1994 earthquakes. Despite direct observations from earthquakes and in the laboratory, three-dimensional (3D) effects of soil nonlinearity on the spatial and temporal distribution of ground shaking are still far from being well-understood. In fact, its effects are still usually omitted or only treated approximately as part of ground shaking forecasting methods. Under this panorama, the main objective of our research was to develop the capability for modeling ground motion in basins due to moderate to strong earthquakes, taking nonlinear soil behavior into consideration, and to apply and validate this capability to realistic situations. Our plan was to first gain physical insight through simplified problems under idealized conditions regarding both nonlinear soil behavior and 3D basin shapes. This report summarizes the approach and first results of our work toward these objectives. Although we initially envisioned this being done in a hybrid two-step manner, combining our own software for large-scale anelastic earthquake simulations with other commercial software capable of modeling plasticity, we later realized that this approach, despite its advantages, had computational constraints in its efficiency and scalability for our own long-term objectives. This led us to reset the course of action and tackle the problem in a direct manner using and enhancing our own software. We have successfully implemented the necessary tools to represent nonlinear soil behavior by incorporating two basic material models for plasticity and have conducted experiments to test our implementation. In this report we describe our methodology and present results for the simulation of a realistic basin with nonlinear soil conditions subjected to two moderate earthquakes, one immediately below and the other far from the basin. We compare the elastic and inelastic response of the basin and discuss the different contrasting results obtained from considering its nonlinear response.},

  Abstract                 = {Large-scale ground motion simulations are being increasingly used to estimate seismic hazard in regions prone to earthquakes. Thus far, these simulations have focused primarily on the source, traveling path, and basin effects at the regional level. They, however, commonly neglect the more local effects of surface topography, geotechnical layers, and the presence of the built environment, mainly because of the multi-scale nature of these physical phenomena and the modeling difficulties they entail. To partially ameliorate this situation, we have modified Hercules---the parallel octree-based finite-element earthquake simulator developed by the Quake group at Carnegie Mellon University---to include the presence of the built environment in large-scale 3D ground motion simulations. We treat buildings as blocks made of the same type of elements used for representing the crustal structure. Buildings are, in a way, geometric extensions to the simulation domain, and their foundations are immerse bodies in full contact with the soil. This allows us to study---in full 3D and at a regional scale not possible before---their influence on the ground motion due to the multiple, simultaneous soil-foundation-structure interaction effects. We present results for simple idealized cases, as a first parametric approach to site-city effects, and report on the simulation of an earthquake scenario in a realistic basin with a city-like arrangement of 74 buildings. Our results suggests that presence of the buildings and their foundations has important effects on the ground motion. Within the city, surface waves are channeled through and trapped in between the foundations and significantly altered in amplitude and spatial variability. We also observe significant changes in the buildings excitation and response. These are all important factors in urban seismology and engineering, and we envision their incorporation in future microzonation and seismic hazard studies.}

  Abstract                 = {Three-dimensional simulations of earthquakes have given a deeper understanding of wave propagation and site effects in urban regions. In this work we study the impact of a potential major earthquake on the San Andreas Fault with significant seismic hazard in the Greater Los Angeles Basin. We present results for the ShakeOut simulation---a rupture beginning near Salton Sea, California, heading 270 km northwest along the fault, that produces a Mw 7.8 earthquake in a geographical region which includes all major populated areas of Southern California and northern Mexico, in a 600 km by 300 km by 80 km volume, for a maximum frequency of 1.0 Hz and a minimum shear wave velocity of 200 m/s. For the material model, we use a discretized version of SCEC's CVM4 velocity model, called CVM-Etree. The simulation was performed at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center using Hercules, a finite element octree-based, parallel software developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie Mellon University. Hercules implements a highly efficient end-to-end algorithm for solving the wave field in highly heterogeneous media due to kinematic faulting. We verify our results by comparing synthetic seismograms computed with a parallel finite difference code by Robert Graves (URS) for a similar scenario earthquake, for a maximum frequency of 0.5 Hz and minimum shear wave velocity of 500 m/s. We focus our analysis of the results of the 1.0 Hz ShakeOut simulation on the Los Angeles Basin area, and the Santa Clara River Valley and Oxnard Plain. We examine the site effects present in these two areas and their proneness to capture and amplify seismic waves due to their geological features. Results show a direct correlation between the amplification levels and the local soil and basin profiles.},

  Abstract                 = {Computational modeling has greatly contributed in recent years to the understanding of the effects of the source, wave propagation path, and site effects on earthquake ground motion in urban regions. Due in part to computational limitations and to limitations in the knowledge of the seismic velocities at the required scales, deterministic modeling of ground motion in realistic basins has been restricted to maximum frequencies of about 0.5 Hz. For engineering applications, however, it is necessary to simulate ground motion to much higher frequencies, say up to 10 Hz. Even though stochastic methods have been developed for this purpose, it is nonetheless desirable to be able to extend the range of applicability of deterministic methods beyond current limits, both regarding frequency and cutoff values of the shear wave velocity. A comparison of synthetic seismograms with corresponding observations from earthquakes could help determine the actual limits of deterministic modeling. Results of the simulations can also give additional insight into the spatial and temporal distribution of ground motion for a wide range of frequencies of practical interest.

In this study we describe a scalable, finite element octree-based parallel toolchain for wave propagation modeling developed by the Quake group at Carnegie Mellon University and use it to model the strong shaking over an extended region in Los Angeles and surrounding regions expected from a Mw 7.7 southern San Andreas earthquake. The region and scenario earthquake are similar to the TeraShake 1.3 simulations conducted at SCEC by Olsen et al (2006), except that we consider maximum frequencies up to 1 Hz and minimum shear wave velocities of 300 m/s, instead of 0.5 Hz and 500 m/s used in the earlier studies. We examine the effects of these parameters on individual seismograms and on the peak ground motion, as well as on Fourier and response spectra, in an effort to identify directivity effects and major amplifications associated with characteristic frequencies of the basins.},

  Abstract                 = {Three-dimensional simulations of earthquakes have given a deeper understanding of wave propagation and site effects in urban regions. Following on this interest, we study the impact of a potential major earthquake of significant seismic hazard on the San Andreas Fault. We present results for the Terashake 1.3 simulation---a rupture beginning near Bombay Beach, California heading 200 km north-west that produces a magnitude 7.7 earthquake in a geographical region which includes all major populated areas of Southern California and northern Mexico in a volume of 600 km long by 300 km width and 80 km depth for up to 0.5 Hz and as low as Vs = 500 m/s---using SCEC 3D velocity model, as part of a verification exercise with the results computed by Olsen et al. (2006) for the same scenario earthquake at the San Diego Supercomputing Center. The present simulation was performed at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center using Hercules, a finite element octree-based, parallel tool-chain developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie Mellon University, which implements an innovative and highly efficient end-to-end approach to solve the wave field in highly heterogeneous basins due to kinematic faulting. Synthetic ground motion throughout the seismic region is analyzed through maps of free-surface global behavior as well as detailed time seismograms at a number of individual locations.},

  Abstract                 = {Large-scale ground motion simulations are being increasingly used to estimate seismic hazard in regions prone to earthquakes. Thus far, these simulations have focused primarily on the source, traveling path, and basin effects at the regional level. They, however, commonly neglect the more local effects of surface topography, geotechnical layers, and the presence of the built environment, mainly because of the multi-scale nature of these physical phenomena and the modeling difficulties they entail. To partially ameliorate this situation, we have modified Hercules---the parallel octree-based finite-element earthquake simulator developed by the Quake group at Carnegie Mellon University---to include the presence of the built environment in large-scale 3D ground motion simulations. We treat buildings as blocks made of the same type of elements used for representing the crustal structure. Buildings are, in a way, geometric extensions to the simulation domain, and their foundations are immerse bodies in full contact with the soil. This allows us to study---in full 3D and at a regional scale not possible before---their influence on the ground motion due to the multiple, simultaneous soil-foundation-structure interaction effects. We present results for simple idealized cases, as a first parametric approach to site-city effects, and report on the simulation of an earthquake scenario in a realistic basin with a city-like arrangement of 74 buildings. Our results suggests that presence of the buildings and their foundations has important effects on the ground motion. Within the city, surface waves are channeled through and trapped in between the foundations and significantly altered in amplitude and spatial variability. We also observe significant changes in the buildings excitation and response. These are all important factors in urban seismology and engineering, and we envision their incorporation in future microzonation and seismic hazard studies.}

The new crustal model reveals strong heterogeneity, including local changes of +-30\% with respect to the initial three-dimensional model provided by the Southern California Earthquake Center. The model illuminates shallow features such as sedimentary basins and compositional contrasts across faults. It also reveals crustal features at depth that aid in the tectonic reconstruction of southern California, such as subduction-captured oceanic crustal fragments. The new model enables more realistic and accurate assessments of seismic hazard.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new source-time function, to be used in kinematic modeling of ground-motion time histories, which is consistent with dynamic propagation of earthquake ruptures and makes feasible the dynamic interpretation of kinematic slip models. This function is derived from a source-time function first proposed by Yoffe (1951), which yields a traction evolution showing a slip-weakening behavior. In order to remove its singularity, we apply a convolution with a triangular function and obtain a regularized source-time function called the regularized Yoffe function. We propose a parameterization of this slip-velocity time function through the final slip, its duration, and the duration of the positive slip acceleration (Tacc). Using this analytical function, we examined the relation between kinematic parameters, such as peak slip velocity and slip duration, and dynamic parameters, such as slip-weakening distance and breakdown-stress drop. The obtained scaling relations are consistent with those proposed by Ohnaka and Yamashita (1989) from laboratory experiments. This shows that the proposed source-time function suitably represents dynamic rupture propagation with finite slip-weakening distances.},

A linear two-dimensional model is used, which assumes the soil to be a homogeneous isotropic half-space, the foundation supporting the building to be a rigid embedded cylinder, and in which the building model is an equivalent single-degree-of-freedom oscillator. The system frequency and the system damping ratio are determined by measuring the width and the frequency of the peak in the transfer function of the oscillator relative response, using the analogy with the half-power method for a single-degree-of-freedom fixed-base oscillator. Previous similar studies are for dynamic soil-structure interaction only, and for simplified models in which the stiffness of the soil and the damping due to radiation are represented by springs and dashpots. The study in this paper differs from the previous studies in that the wave passage effects (or the kinematic interaction) are also included, and that no additional simplifications of the model are made. Results are shown for excitation by plane P- and SV-waves.},

The earthquake was initiated by a small thrust event, and is well characterized by a five-segment fault geometry dominated by right-lateral rupture along 220km of the Denali fault. We perform the three-dimensional numerical simulations at unprecedented resolution and reveal significantly enhanced ground motions (directivity) toward the conterminous United States for both body and surface waves.},

  Abstract                 = {The Mw 7.0 Miyagi-Oki earthquake, which occurred on 26 May 2003, was well recorded by the KiK-net and K-net networks. A large number of stations recorded very high peak ground accelerations above 0.5g and large peak ground velocities above 0.5 m/sec. These high ground-motion values are thought to come from a combination of the effect of shallow sediment layers of the upper couple of meters and the enhanced high-frequency ground-motion content associated with this intraslab earthquake. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of sediment amplification at network stations with peak ground acceleration [&ge;]0.3g. Linear site response is first estimated from observed weak motion (aftershock) records. In this case, we use a spectral inversion method, without reference stations, to separate the source, path, and site-response effects. The resulting weak motion analysis for the source, path, and site response agree with other previous studies. The mainshock site response is obtained separately using the same spectral inversion technique with the addition of a frequency-dependent radiation pattern. The comparison of the site amplification from aftershocks with the mainshock indicates the possibility of nonlinear site response at many stations during the Mw 7.0 event. The results also suggest a correlation between low near-surface material velocity and the degree of nonlinearity.},

Octrees are stored as a sequence of fixed sized octant records sorted by a locational code order that is equivalent to a preorder traversal of the tree and a Z-order traversal through the domain. The sorted records are indexed by a conventional file-resident B-tree index and queried using fixed-length locational code keys. A schema can be defined to make an etree portable across different platforms. The etree library provides functions for creating, modifying, and searching octrees, including efficient mechanisms for appending octants and iterating over octants in Z-order. The library is the foundation for a larger research effort aimed at enabling scientists and engineers to solve large physical simulations on their desktop systems by recasting the simulation process to work directly on large etrees stored on disk.},

  Abstract                 = {Parallel supercomputing has traditionally focused on the inner kernel of scientific simulations: the solver. The front and back ends of the simulation pipeline---problem description and interpretation of the output---have taken a back seat to the solver when it comes to attention paid to scalability and performance, and are often relegated to offline, sequential computation. As the largest simulations move beyond the realm of the terascale and into the petascale, this decomposition in tasks and platforms becomes increasingly untenable. We propose an end-to-end approach in which all simulation components---meshing, partitioning, solver, and visualization---are tightly coupled and execute in parallel with shared data structures and no intermediate I/O. We present our implementation of this new approach in the context of octree-based finite element simulation of earthquake ground motion. Performance evaluation on up to 2048 processors demonstrates the ability of the end-to-end approach to overcome the scalability bottlenecks of the traditional approach.},

This approach results in time-consuming file transfers, disk I/O and data format conversions that consume large amounts of network, storage, and computing resources while contributing nothing to applications. We propose an end-to-end approach to parallel supercomputing. The key idea is to replace the cumbersome file interface with a scalable, parallel, runtime data structure, on top of which all simulation components are constructed in a tightly coupled way. We have implemented this new methodology within an octree-based finite element simulation system named Hercules. The only input to Hercules is material property descriptions of a problem domain; the only outputs are lightweight jpegformated images generated as they are simulated at every visualization time step. There is absolutely no other intermediary file I/O. Performance evaluation of Hercules on up to 2048 processors on the AlphaServer system at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center has shown good isogranular scalability and fixed-size scalability.},

This paper describes the SIMQUAKE II test and an analytic method for soil-structure interaction based on explicit finite difference techniques, which consider both nonlinear behavior at the soil-structure interface and nonlinear constitutive behavior of the site. The analytic method is applied to two-dimensional analyses of both 1/8- and 1/12-size structures and results are compared with test measurements. Structural rocking response is shown to be sensitive to the inelastic compaction characteristic of the soil adjacent to the structure.

For calibration, we use global 30 arc sec topographic data and VS30 measurements (here VS30 refers to the average shear-velocity down to 30 m) aggregated from several studies in the United States, as well as in Taiwan, Italy, and Australia. VS30 values are correlated against topographic slope to develop two sets of parameters for deriving VS30: one for active tectonic regions where topographic relief is high, and one for stable shields where topography is more subdued. By taking the gradient of the topography and choosing ranges of slope that maximize the correlation with shallow shear-velocity observations, we can recover, to first order, many of the spatially varying features of site-condition maps developed for California. Our site-condition map for the low-relief Mississippi Embayment also predicts the bulk of the VS30 observations in that region despite rather low slope ranges.We find that maps derived from the slope of the topography are often well correlated with other independently derived, regional-scale site-condition maps, but the latter maps vary in quality and continuity, and subsequently, also in their ability to match observed VS30 measurements contained therein. Alternatively, the slope-based method provides a simple approach to uniform site-condition mapping.After validating this approach in regions with numerous VS30 observations, we subsequently estimate and map site conditions for the entire continental United States using the respective slope correlations.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a rupture model of the Northridge earthquake, determined from the joint inversion of near-source strong ground motion recordings, P and SH teleseismic body waves, Global Positioning System (GPS) displacement vectors, and permanent uplift measured along leveling lines. The fault is defined to strike 122{degrees} and dip 40{degrees} to the south-southwest. The average rake vector is determined to be 101{degrees}, and average slip is 1.3 m; the peak slip reaches about 3 m. Our estimate of the seismic moment is 1.3 {+/-} 0.2 x 1026 dyne-cm (potency of 0.4 km3). The rupture area is small relative to the overall aftershock dimensions and is approximately 15 km along strike, nearly 20 km in the dip direction, and there is no indication of slip shallower than about 5 to 6 km. The up-dip, strong-motion velocity waveforms are dominated by large S-wave pulses attributed to source directivity and are comprised of at least 2 to 3 distinct arrivals (a few seconds apart). Stations at southern azimuths indicate two main S-wave arrivals separated longer in time (about 4 to 5 sec). These observations are best modeled with a complex distribution of subevents: The initial S-wave arrival comes from an asperity that begins at the hypocenter and extends up-dip and to the north where a second, larger subevent is centered (about 12 km away). The secondary S arrivals at southern azimuths are best fit with additional energy radiation from another high slip region at a depth of 19 km, 8 km west of the hypocenter. The resolving power of the individual data sets is examined by predicting the geodetic (GPS and leveling) displacements with the dislocation model determined from the waveform data, and vice versa, and also by analyzing how well the teleseismic solution predicts the recorded strong motions. The general features of the geodetic displacements are not well predicted from the model determined independently from the strong-motion data; likewise, the slip model determined from geodetic data does not adequately reproduce the strong-motion characteristics. Whereas a particularly smooth slip pattern is sufficient to satisfy the geodetic data, the strong-motion and teleseismic data require a more heterogeneous slip distribution in order to reproduce the velocity amplitudes and frequency content. Although the teleseismic model can adequately reproduce the overall amplitude and frequency content of the strong-motion velocity recordings, it does a poor job of predicting the geodetic data. Consequently, a robust representation of the slip history and heterogeneity requires a combined analysis of these data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {From both theoretical and empirical studies, we know that a soft soil layer will amplify seismic waves of certain frequencies and cause damage to structures, depending on the physical properties and the thickness of the layer. Most developed cities are situated on a plane or a basin with soft geological strata. Thus, understanding the characteristics of soft soil response to seismic loading is important. Seismologists and engineers are interested in questions of linear versus non-linear soil response and isotropy versus anisotropy as a soil property. The records of the downhole accelerographs of an array in Lotung provide an opportunity to study these problems. The results show that the soil response in Lotung does not have an anisotropy effect, and significant non-linear soil response occurred during the strong ground motions in which peak ground acceleration values at ground surface are larger than 150 gal.},

However, the number of local earthquakes with magnitude ML [greater double equals] 4.5 in the 15 days following a large event exceeded the number before it in 9 out of 12 cases studied. When earthquakes with ML [greater double equals] 4.0 were considered, then 10 cases showed an increase in seismic activity after the big event.

  Abstract                 = {Non-linear seismic response of soil is studied by comparing the spectral ratios of surface to downhole horizontal accelerations on weak and strong motion. Data from two boreholes are analysed. One is drilled in the alluvial deposits in the south-west quadrant of the SMART 1 array. The second one penetrates Pleistocene terrace deposits in the northern part of the SMART2 array. Observed weak and strong motion spectral ratios are compared with the theoretical ones predicted by the geotechnical soil model which postulates a hysteretic constitutive law. A significant non-linear response is found at the first site for the events with surface peak acceleration exceeding roughly 0-15g. Deamplification of the strong motion occurred in the frequency range from approximately 1 to 10 Hz. The maximum observed difference between the average weak and strong motion amplification functions of an 11 m-thick near-surface stratum is a factor of 2-3. Nonlinear response characteristics are in qualitative agreement with the model. An additional corollary is that the amplification function calculated from the shear wave coda is equivalent to the average amplification calculated over the ensemble of small earthquakes. No statistically significant non-linear response is detected on the second array, that is tentatively accounted for by the stiffer soil conditions and weaker accelerations achieved at the SMART2 site. The results indicate that the non-linear amplification can be detectable at certain soil conditions above a threshold acceleration level.},

  Abstract                 = {Two simple strategies are presented that use random delay times for repeatedly summing the record of a relatively small earthquake to simulate the effects of a larger earthquake. The simulations do not assume any fault plane geometry or rupture dynamics, but realy only on the {omega}-2 spectral model of an earthquake source and elementary notions of source complexity. The strategies simulate ground motions for all frequencies within the bandwidth of the record of the event used as a summand. The first strategy, which introduces the basic ideas, is a single-stage procedure that consists of simply adding many small events with random time delays. The probability distribution for delays has the property that its amplitude spectrum is determined by the ratio of {omega}-2 spectra, and its phase spectrum is identically zero. A simple expression is given for the computation of this zero-phase scaling distribution. The moment rate function resulting from the single-stage simulation is quite simple and hence is probably not realistic for high-frequency (>1 Hz) ground motion of events larger than ML [~] 4.5 to 5. The second strategy is a two-stage summation that simulates source complexity with a few random subevent delays determined using the zero-phase scaling distribution, and then clusters energy around these delays to get an {omega}-2 spectrum for the sum. Thus, the two-stage strategy allows simulations of complex events of any size for which the {omega}-2 spectral model applies. Interestingly, a single-stage simulation with too few {omega}-2 records to get a good fit to an {omega}-2 large-event target spectrum yields a record whose spectral asymptotes are consistent with the {omega}-2 model, but that includes a region in its spectrum between the corner frequencies of the larger and smaller events reasonably approximated by a power law trend. This spectral feature has also been discussed as reflecting the process of partial stress release (Brune, 1970), an asperity failure (Boatwright, 1984), or the breakdown of {omega}-2 scaling due to rupture significantly longer than the width of the seismogenic zone (Joyner, 1984).},

Amon the physical phenomena investigated: the effects caused by local topography, the interaction with other structures, and the dissipation of dynamic energy through the soil medium were described by exact series solutions. Foundations of arbitrary shape, however, were modeled by using an approximate integral representation. This latter method utilizes the principle of superposition and provides flexibility in analyzing numerically the thee-dimensional disc foundations placed on the soil surface. The results indicate that the detailed description for the shape of a rigid foundation placed on a deformable soil medium is not essential in the overall response of the superstructure, but the stress distribution under the disc foundation is quite sensitive to these changes in detail.

In this thesis, several methods for the calculation of foundation compliances for several types of foundation models were discussed, some of which have direct practical applications. The importance of the base input motion induced by incident seismic waves is also stressed, because the seismic input, along with the foundation compliances, are necessary for a complete analysis of this problem.},

The choice of the cylindrical coordinate system, suitable for analysis of rigid foundations with semi-circular cross section, has lead to the exact infinite series solution, which is ideal for the analysis of the physical nature of this problem and its dependence on several key parameters. It has been shown that the presence of neighboring buildings may change the nature of the single soil-structure interaction problem appreciably and that scattering, diffraction, and interference of waves from and around several foundations with the incident SH waves can lead to significant shielding, as well as amplification of input motion for any of the buildings in a group. The effects of relative size of two, three and several foundations and their separation distances have been studied and presented in some detail.},

Three components of the displacement field were measured at 13 points along a line traversing an elongated canyon underlain by a shallow and dipping alluvial layer. The variations of measured displacement amplitudes have been modeled by (a) a two dimensional surface topographic feature corresponding to the average cross section of the canyon and (b) by a two-dimensional model of an alluvium valley excited by a line source. Comparison of the observed and computed amplitude variations with distance suggests that for the geometry corresponding to this experiment the effect of the dipping layer of alluvium seems to play a considerably more important role than the canyon.},

  Abstract                 = {We combine geodetic, geologic, and seismic information to estimate frequencies of damaging earthquakes in three types of seismotectonic zone. Type A zones contain faults for which paleoseismic data suffice to estimate conditional probabilities. Type B zones contain faults with insufficient data for conditional probability analysis. Type C zones contain diverse or hidden faults. Each zone is assumed to have randomly distributed earthquakes plus characteristic earthquakes on specific faults. Our ``cascade'' model allows for multiple-segment earthquakes. Within each zone, distributed earthquakes are assumed uniform in time and space, with a truncated Gutenberg-Richter magnitude distribution. Thus, seismic hazard is defined by the characteristic earthquake rate, the rate of all distributed events, and the limiting (characteristic) magnitude. Limiting magnitudes are determined from fault lengths, while earthquake rates are determined by observed seismicity and seismic moment rate. We present a preferred seismic hazard model with lognormal recurrence and an alternate Poissonian model. The models predict 80 to 90 percent probability of an m [greater double equals] 7 earthquake within southern California before 2024. The 17 January 1994 Northridge earthquake occurred within the 13 percent of southern California's area having the highest moment rate density. The probability of 0.2 g or greater shaking before 2024 exceeds 60 percent in the Ventura and San Bernardino areas, and 50 percent throughout the Transverse Ranges between Santa Barbara and San Bernardino. The predicted seismicity exceeds that observed historically. This may imply that (1) we underestimate the maximum magnitudes, (2) significant strain may be released aseismically, or (3) seismicity may have been anomalously low since 1850.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we report on the development and application of a parallel numerical methodology for simulating large-scale earthquake-induced ground motion in highly heterogeneous basins whose soil constituents can deform nonlinearly. We target sedimentary basins with large contrasts in wavelengths for which regular grid methods become inefficient, and overcome the problem of multiple physical scales by using unstructured finite element triangulations. We illustrate the methodology with an example of an idealized basin, which contains a deep and a shallow sub-basin. The simulations show significant amplitude reduction of the ground accelerations due to inelastic soil behavior at sites above the deepest portions of the sub-basins, yet little shift in frequency. Under the assumption of linear anelastic material behavior, there is a rapid spatial distribution of the ground acceleration of the basin, which differs markedly from that for a one-dimensional (1D) analysis. This characteristic three-dimensional nature of the ground motion is preserved for the elastoplastic model. Concerning the ground displacement, the main qualitative difference between the elastic and inelastic models is the occurrence of significant permanent deformations in the inelastic case. These residual displacements can have practical implications for the design of long structures such as bridges and structures with large plan dimensions.},

  Abstract                 = {Several examples are used to verify the domain reduction method (DRM), a two-step finite-element methodology described in a companion article for modeling earthquake ground motion in highly heterogeneous three-dimensional localized regions. The first set involves a simple, flat-layered system. Verification of the DRM for this problem is carried out by comparing the results to those calculated directly by the theoretical Green's function method. Its applicability to more general problems is illustrated by two examples: a basin and a hill with and without a weathered surface layer and with the same stratigraphy. We use a Green's function approach for the first step, which for the examples under consideration needs to be performed only once. For the second step, the domain of computation is reduced in each case to a small neighborhood of the geological feature at hand. The second application considers the ground motion due to a strike-slip double couple buried 14 km below the free surface in an 80-km x 80-km x 30-km region that encloses entirely the Los Angeles basin. This problem is solved first by the finite-element method using the single-step traditional approach, in which the ground motion is calculated simultaneously near the seismic source, along the propagation path, and within the region of interest with a single model that encompasses the entire geological structure, from the source to the region of interest. The DRM is then used to determine anew the ground motion over a much smaller (6-km x 6-km x 0.6-km) region contained within the original domain, and the results of the two methods within this region of interest are compared. These examples serve to demonstrate that in many applications the DRM can be significantly more efficient than the traditional approach. The DRM can be particularly advantageous (1) if the source is far from the local structure and the local structure is much softer than that of the exterior region, (2) if the localized feature exhibits nonlinear behavior, or (3) if for a prescribed source, one wishes to consider a sequence of simulations in which the properties of the local feature, which might include man-made structures, are varied from one simulation to the next.},

  Abstract                 = {A numerical code for calculating the time-domain response of a nonlinear soil-to-base excitation is used to examine the characteristics of strong-motion accelerograms recorded in soil. The results verify several of the effects that are usually cited as evidence of nonlinearity: decreased spectral ratios of surface-to-input motion near the dominant frequency of the soil; decreased statistical uncertainty in prediction of peak acceleration; and increased effective period of surface motion. When examined in the Fourier-transform domain, the results show that the soil response can be separated into three frequency bands. In the lowest frequency range, the spectral amplitudes are not affected by the nonlinearity. In the central band, the spectral amplitudes are decreased. The increase in the dominant period is caused primarily by a strong decrease in the amplitude of shorter-period waves, rather than by amplification of low-period motion. Above a cross-over frequency, however, the spectral amplitudes at the free surface are increased relative to linear soil response calculations. This is a consequence of the sudden change in the stiffness of the soil at reversals in the stress-strain curve. This increase in spectral amplitudes at high frequencies causes the spectral decay parameter {kappa} to decrease for the soil model that was used. The transition frequencies separating these three types of behavior shift to lower frequencies as the thickness of the soil layer is increased.},

The parameters identified are the shear moduli of several near-field soil regions as well as Young's moduli of the shell sections of the structure. The soil-structure interaction system is represented by the finite element method combined with infinite element formulation for the unbounded layered soil medium. Preliminary investigations are carried out on the results of the static stress analysis for the soil medium and the results of the in-situ tests to divide the soil-structure system into several regions with homogeneous properties and to determine the lower and upper bounds of the parameters for the purpose of identification. Then two sets of parameters are identified for two principal directions based on the forced vibration test data by minimizing the estimation error using the constrained steepest descent method. The simulated responses for the forced vibration tests using the identified parameters show excellent agreement with the test data. The present estimated parameters are also found to be well compared with the average value of those by other researchers in the joint project.},

In this paper, free-field downhole array seismic records are employed to identify and model the recorded response at Wildlife Refuge (California, USA) and Port Island (Kobe, Japan) sites. The Wildlife Refuge site was instrumented in 1982 with a two-accelerometer array and six piezometers that recorded a case of seismically induced site liquefaction. At Port Island, a four-accelerometer down-hole array recorded strong motion during the recent 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquake. This earthquake resulted in widespread liquefaction and major ground deformations at Port Island. Using the recorded downhole accelerations at these two sites, the actual seismic shear stress-strain histories are directly evaluated. These histories provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of site liquefaction and associated loss of stiffness and strength. Based on the identified dynamic soil behaviors, computational simulations of the observed seismic response are performed. Optimization techniques are employed to estimate the necessary computational modeling parameters. This document constitutes the second part of a set of two companion papers about site amplification and liquefaction.},

Soil stiffness properties are found to compare satisfactorily with those obtained through laboratory tests conducted by the University of California, Davis; the National Taiwan University; and the University of Texas at Austin. Pore pressure buildup appears to be accompanied by a reduction in soil stiffness.

  Abstract                 = {In an attempt to estimate the intensity of ground motion that the Marina District, San Francisco, California, experienced during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, we investigate the 3D seismic response of a 2D model (referred to in the present article as ``2.5D model'') of a SW-NE trending cross section of the Marina Basin. As a first step in this endeavor, the simulated elastic response characteristics of the model are compared with recorded aftershock data. The comparison, in terms of peak amplitudes, duration, and frequency content of the time response, is favorable. In simulating the response of the Marina Basin to the Loma Prieta mainshock excitation, we account for the effect of soil nonlinearities by an iterative procedure, referred to as the ``equivalent linear approach'' according to which the values of soil damping and stiffness are selected to be consistent with the level of strain. Our results show that accelerations and velocities may have reached values as high as 0.23 g and 34 cm/sec, respectively; strains induced by wave propagation were of the order of 10--4, while spectral acceleration $Sa$ for damping ratio 5 percent reached values as high as 0.8 g for periods in the range of 0.8[less double equals]T[less double equals]1.2 sec, which contains the fundamental frequencies of the most heavily damaged structures in the Marina District. The simulations confirm the conjecture made by Hanks and Brady (1991) that the motion recorded at Treasure Island is the most likely strong-motion surrogate for the filled areas of the Marina District. Based on the results of the simulations, it may be stated that for strong-motion (i.e., large strain) excitation, 3D focusing and lateral interferences, while still present, are not as prominent as in the weak-motion (i.e., small-strain) excitation case. The above conclusion suggests that, in general, the damping characteristics of soil deposits (particularly of poorly consolidated soft-soil deposits, i.e., mean shear-wave velocity of the upper 30 m of deposits, less than 200 m/sec), selected to be consistent with the level of strain induced by the seismic excitation, are a key factor in controlling the nature of the overall response of a sedimentary basin. Finally, in computing empirical amplification ratios based on recorded motions, selection of an appropriate "free-field" motion, representative of the incident excitation, is very crucial.},

The equations are based on a modified hyperbolic model and a statistical analysis of existing Resonant Column and Torsional Shear test results for 122 specimens obtained from South Carolina, North Carolina, and Alabama. Variables used in the equations for normalized shear modulus are: shear-strain amplitude, confining stress, and plasticity index (PI). The equations for damping ratio are expressed in terms of a polynomial function of normalized shear modulus plus a minimum damping ratio. It is found that the Quaternary soils exhibit more linearity than soils of the other two groups. Also, it is found that the effect of PI on dynamic soil behavior is not as significant as previously thought. Data from all three groups exhibit significant variations with confining stress, similar to the variations determined by Stokoe et al. The uncertainties associated with the equations for PI of 0 and mean effective confining stress of 100 kPa are quantified using the point estimate method. A case study from Charleston, S.C. is provided to illustrate an application of the equations to seismic response analysis and the importance of considering confining stress and geologic age.},

  Abstract                 = {Performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) is emerging as the next-generation design and evaluation framework under which new and existing structures will be analyzed for seismic adequacy. Various analytical approaches to PBEE are in development [1]. The PBEE methodology developed by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) Center, headquartered at the University of California, Berkeley, is being exercised and illustrated on real, existing facilities (buildings, bridges, network of highway bridges, campus of buildings) called testbeds. This paper presents the application of the PEER PBEE methodology to one of the six PEER testbeds, namely the Humboldt Bay Middle Channel (HBMC) Bridge, one of three bridges that cross Humboldt Bay, near Eureka in northern California. It is a 330 meter long, nine-span composite structure with precast and prestressed concrete I-girders with cast-in-place concrete slabs, fairly representative of older AASHTO-Caltrans girder bridges with moderate traffic loads. It is supported on eight pile groups in soils potentially vulnerable to liquefaction during an earthquake, which could induce lateral spreading and permanent soil deformations. This bridge testbed is analyzed as a nonlinear structure-foundation-soil system.

This paper focuses on the several analytical steps of the PEER PBEE methodology to assess the seismic reliability of the HBMC Bridge. This methodology integrates probabilistic seismic hazard analysis for the bridge site, advanced computational modeling of the bridge-foundation-soil system, probabilistic seismic demand analysis, probabilistic capacity (or fragility) analysis, and reliability analysis. The earthquake response of the bridge ground system is simulated using a two-dimensional, advanced nonlinear finite element model of the structure-foundation-soil system developed in OpenSees, the new PEER software framework for advanced finite element modeling and seismic response simulation of structural and geotechnical systems. Several potential failure mechanisms are considered such as flexural failure of bridge piers, failure of shear key(s), and unseating. For each failure mechanism, several limit-states or damage-states measuring the stage of formation of the failure mechanism are considered. The seismic reliability against these system-level limit-states is expressed in terms of mean annual frequency (Poisson rate) of exceeding these limit-states or, alternatively, the return period of these limit-states. The paper presents selective results illustrating the various steps of the PEER PBEE methodology as well as their integration.},

  Abstract                 = {The Middle Channel Humboldt Bay Bridge near Eureka, California, was selected as a testbed in the ongoing development of a performance-based earthquake engineering design and assessment methodology at the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) Center. A two-dimensional, advanced nonlinear computational model of the structure-foundation-soil system for the Middle Channel Bridge has been developed using OpenSees, the new PEER software framework for seismic response simulation of structural and geotechnical systems.

This paper presents and discusses a simplified, yet improved definition of the seismic excitation along the boundaries of the soil domain included in the finite element model of the structure-foundation-soil system. This seismic excitation assumes vertically incident shear waves and a linear elastic, undamped, and homogeneous semi-infinite half-space underlying the nonlinear soil region modeled. It is also consistent with free field (rock and soil) actual earthquake records representative of the seismicity of Humboldt Bay. The proposed treatment of the boundary conditions includes transmitting/absorbing boundaries in order to limit the occurrence of spurious seismic wave reflections along the boundaries of the modeled soil medium. 

Using simple (single wavelet) and complex (earthquake-like) incident wave motions, the dynamic response of the bridge-foundation-soil system obtained using the above modeling assumptions is compared to that obtained under the common assumption of a total rigid base excitation in conjunction with shear beam constraints across the longitudinal direction of the soil domain. The computational model developed is exercised to assess the effects of soil nonlinearity (including lateral spreading) on the seismic response of the structure-foundation-soil system.},

  Abstract                 = {The behaviour of all geomaterials, and in particular of soils, is governed by their interaction with the pore fluid. The mechanical model of this interaction when combined with suitable constitutive discription of the solid phase and with efficient, discrete, computation procedures, allows most transient and static problems involving deformations to be solved. This paper describes the basic procedures and the development of a general purpose computer program (SWANDYNE-X). The results of the computations are validated by comparison with experimental results obtained on physical models tested in the Cambridge Centrifuge.},

  Abstract                 = {The visco-plastic model of material behaviour is of much practical interest in its own right and initial strain techniques for its solution have been developed and proved efficient. More important however is the fact that the visco-plastic model can be used to generate plasticity solutions in a simple manner when stationary conditions are reached and, at the other extreme, can reproduce standard creep phenomena. Used in this sense it allows the treatment of non-associated plasticity and strain softening situations which present difficulties in conventional plasticity approaches. A standard programme thus allows the treatment of a wide range of materially non-linear problems.The paper discusses various applications of the new general formulation and introduces certain numerical information on solution stability.},
